# HOMO-MEX 2024: Hate speech detection towards the Mexican Spanish speaking LGBT+ population

### What is LGBT+phobia?

"LGBT+Phobia" refers to all kinds of discrimination against the LGBT+ population on the basis of their sexual preferences and/or gender identities.

### Why is LGBT+phobia a relevant issue for the NLP community?

The LGBT+ community is especially vulnerable to substance abuse disorders among its members, disproportionate mental health problems, discrimination in the labor markets, and denial of access to education and health services. Despite the global advances against this form of discrimination, LGBT+phobia is still an issue faced by the majority of the LGBT+ population.

Given this scenario, we propose this shared task that aims at improving automatic detection systems designed for the classification of hate speech directed at the LGBT+ community.
