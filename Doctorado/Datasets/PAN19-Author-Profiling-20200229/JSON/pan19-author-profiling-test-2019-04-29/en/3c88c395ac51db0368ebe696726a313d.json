        "@Knowmium you do realize that the thread is bullish ETH, right?",
        "@panekkkk If ETH doesn't consider EOS a threat, please explain Whiteblock and Eth 1.x",
        "18/ We should all be grateful for competition. It really does make the world a better place. Although this thread has been a bit tongue-in-cheek, I really am glad that ETH is getting more aggressive.\n\nNecessity is the mother of invention\n\n{fin}",
        "16/ ETH has been a monopoly for so long, it forgot how to compete.\n\nNow that it has competition, it's starting to move at a much faster pace",
        "15/ It's clear now that Eth 1.x shows that ETH can respond to competition, and can muster resources to try to compete\n\nAnd I like it.",
        "14/ Then, we learned of some secret meetings at/around devcon in which Eth 1.x became a thing\n\nWait, I thought it was duplicative to work on the existing chain still?",
        "13/ The whiteblock report, which was\n\na) laughable in its technical claims (it implied that Bitcoin is not a blockchain)\nb) showed their insecurity\nc) showed how low they're willing to go (even though they claim the moral high ground, e.g \"we don't need $4B!!\")",
        "12/ This resulted in a few things that we've already seen (and perhaps more that we haven't)",
        "11/ Through Oct, EOS kept growing, and for the first time since inception, ETH felt actual competition from the thing that\n\n1) it dismissed\n2) thought was garbage\n3) was the best capitalized\n4) took the easiest path to answer hard questions (while ETH took the hard path)",
        "10/ By August, the narrative around ETH as a dapp platform started to really falter, and ETH price decoupled to the downside from BTC in a meaningful way",
        "9/ Pretty quickly, those use cases came to drive more meaningful on EOS than anything on ETH had sustained\n\nAnd slowly, narrative changed\n\nAnd some businesses started switching from ETH to EOS",
        "8/ Meanwhile, the EOS chain stabilized, and people started doing what they do on all new blockchains: gamble and issue tokens. And to some extent, play games (e.g. EOS knights)",
        "7/ Coming in on the 1 year anniversary of plasma, plasma researchers began to recognize that running the EVM on plasma is basically not possible\n\nhttps://t.co/9r6Psd0ZeY\n\n(Plug: this is why we invested in @skalelabs)",
        "6/ It was going to be so amazing that it didn't even need a timeline\n\nOr answers to questions like data availability (still unanswered)",
        "5/ By July, what started to be called Eth 2.0 had started to take shape. Eth 2.0 was going to be so big, so badass, and so amazing, that it actually required a new version number entirely",
        "4/ Then, at some point around May/June, they realized that the sharding plan was not going to work\n\nSo back to the drawing board they went\n\nMeanwhile, EOS launched. And fell on its face. A few times",
        "3/ Over the first few months 2018, the EF realized that implementing FFG on the existing chain was gong to be duplicative with rolling out CBC and sharding later\n\nSo they decided to skip it entirely, and just focus on sharding",
        "2/ Just 2 months prior, Vitalik had laid out the (now defunct) sharding roadmap at Devcon. Just 5 months prior, he and Joseph had published the plasma paper\n\nFFG was nearly finalized, and CBC was looking good",
        "1/ At the start of 2018, the Ethereum community couldn't be higher off its own supply. Literally",
        "0/ The best thing to happen to Ethereum in 2018 was.....\n\nEOS\n\nA thread",
        "17/ So although ETH price is in the gutter right now, there is a lot to look forward to. While we still don't know much about Eth 1.x, that it's even on the table is a massive step forwards, especially given how much technical risk remains around Eth 2.0",
        "@csheffield3 @danheld @skalelabs Sure. But we are so far away from that it's hard to make any real forecasts about it",
        "@csheffield3 @danheld @skalelabs I think it's crazy to expect people to maintain many open channels for extended periods of time",
        "@alexmagnusBTC @danheld @skalelabs Many orders of magnitude higher than LN, actually :)",
        "@danheld @skalelabs Total channel capacity != Ability to route $1000\n\nI stand by my original statement",
        "@danheld @skalelabs 1) LN usage is not meaningful. If I can't route $1000 it's useless\n\n2) LN is just so much less interesting than off chain EVM execution",
        "This is *very* exciting\n\n@skalelabs just gave their first technical overview of how the SKALE network is going to work\n\nThis is going to be the first widely deployed layer 2 network in crypto with meaningful usage, and which benefits from network effects\n\nhttps://t.co/TRZOW8Hui2",
