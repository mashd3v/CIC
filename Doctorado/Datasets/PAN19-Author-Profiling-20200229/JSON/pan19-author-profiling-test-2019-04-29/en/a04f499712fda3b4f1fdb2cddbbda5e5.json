        "We need to add awareness about Gaslighting to the curriculum too, IMO. Kids often use it as a playground tactic in cliques - it\u2019s such an accessible, self-presenting power-play, so it\u2019s really important we learn how to identify, neutralise &amp; replace it with honest communication.",
        "On a micro (\u2018toxic\u2019 friend, colleague, family member etc.) and macro (Farage, Trump, ISIS, Hitler) basis, this is the semi-sophisticated, triple-bluff art of gaslighting; weaponising disadvantage to protect a goal the perpetrator knows to be flawed.",
