Also Nowhere else in Europe is it a GP lead service.",

Also will have to be prepared, even one TOP will require 3 long consults under the apparent rules. Ask how many GP's have a spare 1-2 hours in any given week?",
        "@williamhboney1 @TodaySOR Firstly I'm pro choice so thats were I am coming from, secondly there are simply going to be a hard core who will not refer. A generation of being taught it is illegal and unethical will not vanish overnight or by coercion.",
