Politicians don\u2019t campaign for the votes of migrants but for migrants\u2019 perceived influence over the votes of relatives back home.

        "AMLO campaigned in 8 US cities even though this is technically against Mexican election law. This was a big change in campaign strategy from 2006 when he refused to go to the US at all. He was helped by electoral reforms that eased registration abroad.",
        "But diaspora Mexicans were never a reliable base for the PAN given their socioeconomic diversity. Having failed to halt corruption and violence after two terms in office, the party had squandered much of its legacy as the party of democratic change among Mexicans abroad.",
        "For 2 decades, the default opposition party for Mexicans abroad (mostly US) was the PAN, beginning with Fox, who had widespread diaspora support. In 2012, V\u00e1zquez Mota won the largest vote share in the diaspora despite getting the smallest vote share overall.",
        "The PRI, being in power for 7 decades, produced 7 decades of emigrants who blamed the party for the conditions under which they left. Other Mexican parties compete for diaspora support by being the most viable alternative to the PRI.",
        "The consistent trend across all elections is the disproportionate skew against the PRI. The Mexico diaspora vote isn\u2019t pro-PAN or pro-AMLO. It is anti-PRI.",
