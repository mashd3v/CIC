        "The point is not to make policy decisions based on anecdote but based on aggregate data, and also (critically!) test for whether the relationships you think are there really are there.",
        "FWIW, I believe the owners of those 8 establishments who say they closed down because of the min. wage hike. I could also cherry pick 8 or 100 or 1000 establishments who would tell me they did not shut down because of the min. wage hike. Or hired more, or fewer workers, etc.",
        "In order to \u201cprove\u201d the min. wage hike caused restaurants to close but also hire more workers (but not enough!), Saltsman resorts to anecdote, cherry picking individual friendly restaurant owners. Specifically, 8 restaurants. Out of 18,571 in the state. https://t.co/F7VbqxBKc9",
        "Why isn\u2019t correlation causation? Because there\u2019s a million other factors besides the tipped min. wage that may make a restaurant owner want to lay off workers or close a restaurant. Retirement. Bad weather. Death in the family. Factory in town closed down.",
        "(Aside: the standard argument against min. wage hikes is that they cause unemployment. The BLS data we and Saltsman use show the opposite: employment went up, not down. But Saltsman wants to say this is actually a negative, because it should have gone up more. Moving goalposts.)",
        "Instead, he presents simple descriptive data, which tells you nothing by itself. A: the tipped min went up, and B: employment went up (slightly) and number of establishments went down (slightly). To just point to that and say A caused B, I rest my case, is not a serious argument.",
        "For studies on the impact of minimum wages, the standard tools are difference-in-differences and regression discontinuity design. This is what every other min. wage study does, by economists on the left and right, what we model our study on, and what Saltsman does not.",
        "The entire field of econometrics was developed to deal with these problems of endogeneity. Statistics is not, as Saltsman believes, just bar charts and data. It\u2019s applying a set of tools to distinguish causal from spurious relationships, to separate the signal from the noise.",
        "In polisci and economics, looking at trends particularly at some macro (e.g. statewide) level means there are an unlimited number of other factors that affect what you\u2019re trying to look at. Demographic changes, elections, crime, war, etc. There\u2019s always a C, D, E, on to infinity.",
        "Why? Because A may cause B. But B may cause A. \u201cUmbrellas cause rain\u201d is the classic reverse causation fallacy. Or there may be some unobserved other factor, C, that causes both A and B. \u201cBasketball season causes the flu\u201d is the classic spurious causation fallacy.",
        "Correlation is not causation, first lesson in stats 101.",
        "First, basics of causal inference: Let\u2019s say you have two things that happen at the same time, A and B. Say, a change in the minimum wage and a change in employment. Just because you observe these two things happen at the same time does not by itself prove anything.",
        "Saltsman, writing on behalf of the restaurant industry, believes raising the tipped minimum wage is bad. That\u2019s his opinion and he\u2019s entitled to it. But he attempts to marshal data that tell us nothing, statistically, and wants to convince us otherwise.",
        "This thread by @Mike_Saltsman is a pretty great lesson in bad causal inference and example of why, in my opinion, there should be a higher bar for people who want to write about statistics. https://t.co/c0ylgq7T7d",
