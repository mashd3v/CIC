        "Link is still working. https://t.co/NmkAlSlCp2. Same for all other teams. League hosting all team sites in a templated format. Makes sense from OWL perspective. Wonder if they were allowed to develop their own standalone ones or if these were part of the franchise agreements.",

        "6. Capture your gameplay if possible. Crude highlights, crazy goals, insane combos. Show off those skills! Challenger is online only and between players so most matches can\u2019t be watched - perhaps stream your attempt to make top 30, build an audience!",
        "5. Understand what\u2019s required of you. The Elite Series is a weekly offline event. You may need to be travelling each weekend. If you\u2019re European that can be tough. Heck if you\u2019re a few hours from London it can be a challenge. Prepare for that.",
        "4. If you can, stream. If teams can\u2019t see you and get a feeling for what you\u2019re about, you\u2019re just a number. Teams want personalities, not just performers. We survey all draft players but teams want to know you before it gets that far!",
        "3. Get your socials in order. The Challenger Series is all about identifying talent. Make the top 30 for draft? You better be sure you\u2019re active socially and up to date. The more info teams have on players, the more likely to draft them.",
        "2. Play as many Cups as you can. G-points mean climbing that leaderboard. Finish in the top 30 and you can be drafted. Consistency &gt; One big win. Don\u2019t rest on those laurels!",
        "1. Complete your Challenger Series profile on the website. Franchises see who\u2019s winning in the Cups and topping the Leaderboards - if you have your Twitter handle in your profile as well as location etc that makes it far easier for them to scout you!",
