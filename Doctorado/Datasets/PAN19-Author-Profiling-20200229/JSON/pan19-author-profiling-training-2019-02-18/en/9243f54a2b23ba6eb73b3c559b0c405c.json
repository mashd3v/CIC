        "Quite like this stock wallpaper on the new iPad Pro. https://t.co/essFKayi8M",
        "I use GoodNotes for planning novels, and I also write a letter to my wife each morning when she's travelling on business (like this week), sending it via email. Today's letter was the first with the new iPad and Apple Pencil, and easy switching to the eraser is HUGELY useful. https://t.co/4I3yfgPmlq",
        "I did see the folding phone, and it perfectly illustrated the problem with the idea: you've got a lovely little mini-tablet thing, and it folds to be even more portable, and everything is great\u2026 but then it turns into the ugliest, thickest, stubbiest little phone ever.",
        "I watched the Samsung keynote, and learned that I'm very uncomfortable watching people from other companies transparently mimicking the Jobs/Apple style of presentation. Language, cadence, message\u2026 all feels like a knock-off. It's better than Middle-Aged Men In Suits, but hrmm.",
        "Mic drop; debate ended forever. https://t.co/ASWaRzgSur",
        "@DjAtkins Yes, I finally had a go yesterday, and it's so like WoW. From the character choice screen to the bloody mailbox outside the first inn. I know my wife and I are going to play far too much of it.",
        "@bigtruck1369 @wasdkeyboards Yes and yes. Freely adjustable through pretty much horizontal to vertical.",
        "@imthaz I noticed that. I never had to replace the nib on my previous one, but it'd be nice to have.",
        "@erynofwales CHAK, it says. It's definitely CHAK.",
        "@awk \ud83d\ude01",
        "Also, the double-tap action is fab. Really light, and you can do it anywhere in the frontmost third of the Pencil, excluding the nib, and on any area around its circumference. It's lovely and gentle on the fingers, but I doubt you could do it accidentally while adjusting grip. https://t.co/JGB5TFrrHP",
        "Two things about the new Pencil with the iPad Pro. First, the magnetic coupling is REALLY positive (ha ha). It just grabs the thing. Easy enough to peel back off, but there's no question that the iPad has got a grip of the Pencil. https://t.co/4oS6hxVHXy",
        "@awk Nope, it's a strat!",

        "@DaveGomez @wasdkeyboards Thank you. Me too!",

        "Here's the new panel in Settings for the Apple Pencil 2. https://t.co/Ivvidcl1Fi",
        "@imthaz @wasdkeyboards No regrets about the 12.9 here. Big and stunning, but not unwieldy.",
        "@darylbaxter @wasdkeyboards Realised I didn't move it around much, and could use extra space for working with outlines, sketches/plans, mind maps, and book cover work. Also it's smaller than the previous 12.9, so less compromise.",
        "@chrisdomico Looks same as back to me.",
        "Oh, and the new Pencil! It's\u2026 a Pencil, in a wee box. The iPad shows an adjacent, rotating life-size overlay of the Pencil when you first attach it.\n\nFlat side always goes towards iPad, but you can have the tip either up or down. Magnets are SECURE. Like, pull-iPad-over secure. https://t.co/0yZWhkfzrN",
        "@darylbaxter @wasdkeyboards I think the 11\" will be the right model for most people.",
        "Case makers in China seem to have been caught out by the new iPad Pro's Pencil integration. They all have cutouts for the magnetic port itself, but not for the Pencil's body around it.",

        "@breakthesystem Never. Once every few months, I'll have some piece of mail to deal with, but I do that the same day then recycle it.",
        "@DigDoug I've never really been bothered by those. I'd prefer better photos to a flat back.",

        "Check that gorgeous edge. You can see the Pencil mag/pair/charge panel further down, albeit out of focus. This is the space grey iPad. https://t.co/YHdrnUWhj9",
        "Naturally I have to show you my home office setup now. Gorgeous big mechanical keyboard from @wasdkeyboards (CHOK CHOK CHOK), connected via Apple USB-C adapter. I keep the iPad in portrait orientation because it's page-like for writing. Aeron chair. Lamicall iPad stand. https://t.co/BZgd7E8qSF",
        "Here's the new 12.9\" with my existing 10.5\", to give an idea of the size different. It looks huge here, but in real life the 12.9 really doesn't feel cumbersomely big. https://t.co/NuIZGVtXTL",
        "Heeey who wants to see some pics of the new iPad Pro 12.9\"? You? And _you_?",
        "@ladywhimsy @wasdkeyboards Remember that those keyboards use standard Cherry MX switches, so you can order replacement keycaps from pretty much anywhere, at any time.",
        "@ladywhimsy @wasdkeyboards Yes. Each keyboard (and each set of caps) includes a wire keycap puller. It's very easy to do, though a few keys (space, right shift, return, backspace) are slightly more fiddly. Still easy! Videos on the wasd support site.",
        "@arnisvanur @alpower This is a 256GB wifi space grey 12.9\" model.",
        "@chrisdejabet @1Password It's so, so much easier than before with 1Password and the iOS 12 integration, aye. Still takes a while with all the apps!",
        "When you use the Share popover on iOS and choose (e.g.) Messages, it'd be nice to have a quick-access display of most commonly chosen recipients, instead of always having to type/autocomplete. About 95% of my messages go to my wife.",

        "iPad excitement notwithstanding, it's been a tough few days. Mrs G is travelling for work, and I sleep really badly when she's not here. I can tolerate it immeasurably better since we added this chap to the family, though. Thanks for keeping me company, best pal. https://t.co/xAZ44tiwb6",

        "@four_sides UK General Elections still use FPTP, but our own Scottish local council elections are STV PR, and our parliamentary elections are AMS-type PR (\"MMP\"). I do believe that the Scottish systems work effectively, but nothing is perfect.",
        "@four_sides Tough question. To be necessarily brief, I believe in the core idea of PR absolutely, but I acknowledge the practical barriers it can sometimes impose create to decision making. Scotland uses a hybrid system incorporating both FPTP and PR at various levels.",
