        "@Naysayerz @F_Word_FGC @Rob_Morg_Black will have valuable insight here, but as TOs we are more like traditional businesses, just in that space.",

        "@Rahul__Uppal @Epsilon_Grumpy Let\u2019s not forget that all those teams (Dig, Immortals etc) also have huge VC funds powering them. They\u2019re hardly restricted.",

        "@Epsilon_Grumpy @Rahul__Uppal That\u2019s fair to an extent, but in the other side these brands can bring a lot of desperately needed infrastructure and expertise.",
        "@Epsilon_Grumpy @Rahul__Uppal Side effect with any high growth product unfortunately. Until a brand steps up and flips the meta like Fnatic it\u2019s challenging.",
