        "@wxjay @judah47 @MJVentrice well I wasn't trying to put a timeline on it and yes it has been around a while.. but the study still is in its early stages compared to many other parts of the industry. it does sorta feel it's become more concrete over the past decade even but maybe a misconception.",
        "I've decided not to look at models anymore for this storm because why... but radar looks pretty nice. See if this band can set up somewhere. https://t.co/8FVQA801Kq",

        "@DanielJohnsonWx it's not a bad run overall. tho should figure out how much of the total is the light precip that goes on forever",
        "Should learn to wait for the high rez.. not bad, and actually wetter than 12z west. Pretty small moves at this point. It did tighten up the gradient to the north. Bumps at this point. You'll notice I didn't mention the GFS tonight because #lolgfs. #nameurorule https://t.co/EnI63Kbm0z",
        "@Red_Head_Ed we also overfocus on qpf when it's not the best variable when it comes to skill on a model. some of the changes we see at this range are error as much as anything. the northern edge seems locked in place tho heh. still got 2 more suites.. or 3 I guess.",
        "Drier than 18z but not the worst. Raising numbers late generally seems to be met with a set of runs that throws some caution to the wind.  \n\nOne interesting aspect is the DC area might get in on the typical banding on NW edge that can pump totals past model numbers.",

        "@Wxmanms1 @JoeTheWXMan17 @mattlanza @rboyle31 as far as I can tell many of these past events were also well forecast. I know Jan 2011 here was.. as was the NYC area superband. again there are prob a few diff types of snarling events but these seem a bit specific to intensity.",
        "@rboyle31 @JoeTheWXMan17 @mattlanza @Wxmanms1 I've taken a bit of an interest in these as well. I've been tempted to become a traffic nerd before. Anthony Downs was one of those people I read before I ended up in DC.. can be fascinating stuff.",
        "@JoeTheWXMan17 @mattlanza @Wxmanms1 @rboyle31 yeah I dunno. I think there are other cases like the light accum or trace of ice causing things to go haywire which might have easier solutions in some ways. there's just no way around crazy rates piling up while cars sit on a road then plows cant get through.",
        "@Wxmanms1 @mattlanza @rboyle31 I might be underthinking it but it seems to me a great solution when it's absolutely ripping is to not have tons of cars on the road. I do imagine many would not necessarily heed a shelter in place warning... so cancel the whole day? What if it busts etc. Maybe it's just a thing.",
        "@JoeTheWXMan17 @mattlanza @Wxmanms1 @rboyle31 they seem to follow similar patterns.. at least the massive meltdowns. happened here in Jan 2011.. feds let our early.. into what became ripping thundersleet then went to heavy snow and people were stuck into the next morning. NYC in Nov was similar too. https://t.co/KUXNRggFO7",
        "@rboyle31 @Wxmanms1 bad driving will always happen in bad weather but at a certain point snow rates are just too much. if you send a ton of people out into them a massive traffic jam of stuck people has to be one of the most likely outcomes.",
        "@mattlanza @Wxmanms1 @rboyle31 even with no cars 1-2\"/hr rates are almost impossible to keep up with esp at the higher end. shelter in place might seem extreme but possible it would be like 3 hours while the worst moved through instead of 12 stuck on a road next to a bunch of unhappy folks.",
        "@Wxmanms1 @rboyle31 yeah it seems sorta similar to other instances here, nyc, elsewhere. I am not sure it can be solved by good forecasts. almost like people should shelter in place (no leaving where they are) until the roads are cleared in those instances.",
        "@HWPCWX and it's still going heh",
        "@USWeatherExpert @ltgcg at least at times I should say.. not sure it's always. I think certain regimes (nina) the GFS has done better in.. maybe because it fits its bias better? I dunno.",
        "@USWeatherExpert @ltgcg it's oversimplified here and I'll prob keep looking at both but I really do believe it makes forecasts worse or less certain at the least. in this storm here if we didn't factor it in things would look less confusing.",
