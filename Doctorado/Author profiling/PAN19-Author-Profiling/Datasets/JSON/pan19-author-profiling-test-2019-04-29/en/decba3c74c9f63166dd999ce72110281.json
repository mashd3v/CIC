        "In early June, at the edge of a field\nthick with pink and yellow flowers\nI meet them.",
        "a jungle redeemed by these linked sentences\ncarved out when an author traveled and a reader\nkept the way open.",
        "At any distance\nit fell without a break or seam, and slowly, a simple\npreponderance\u2014\na fall of flowers\u2014",
        "The light burns upward,\nit thickens and settles over the fields.",
        "that anything is ever final\u2014\nthat anything, in spite of its absence,\never dies\na perfect death?",
        "and I want\nto live my life all over again, to begin again,\nto be utterly\nwild.",
        "we are risen, tangled together, certain to fall\nback to the sea.",
        "It lifts its head,\nit lifts the hinges\n\nof its snowy wings,\ntossing a moment of light\nin every direction,\nlike a chandelier,\n\nand then once more is still.",
        "and the ponds appear\nlike black cloth\non which are painted islands\nof summer lilies.",
        "And that was followed by, guess what, a momentous and\nbeautiful silence",
        "all day I think of her\u2014\nher white teeth,\nher wordlessness,\nher perfect love.",
        "it was\na flock of snow geese, winging it\nfaster than the ones we usually see,",
        "In winter\nall the singing is in\nthe tops of the trees\nwhere the wind-bird\nwith its white eyes\nshoves and pushes\namong the branches.",
        "Therefore I have given precedence\nto all my sudden, sullen, dark moods\nthat hold you in the center of my world.",
        "I think of this every morning\nas the east begins\nto tear off its many clouds\nof darkness,",
        "You only have to let the soft animal of your body\nlove what it loves.",
        "I don't know the name of this bird,\nI only imagine his glittering beak\ntucked in a white wing\nwhile the clouds\u2014",
        "I don't even think\nof the eventual corruption of my body,\nbut of how quaint and humorous they are,\nlike a collection of doorknobs,\nhalf-moons,\nthen a yellow drizzle of flying saucers.",
        "I want to believe that the imperfections are nothing\u2014\nthat the light is everything\u2014",
        "and at night\nlights up the deep and wondrous\ndrownings of the body\nlike a star.",
        "I had nothing\nbetter to do\nthan listen.",
        "as we glide\nOver the final jutting mountainside,\nAcross the suburbs tangled in their lights,",
        "Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.",
        "And that was followed by, guess what, a momentous and\nbeautiful silence",
        "It is always underfoot,\nlike a summons,\ngravel-backed and mossy,\nin every beetled basin\u2014",
        "The gospel of\nlight is the crossroads of\u2014indolence, or action.",
        "clearly I'm not needed,\nyet I feel myself turning\ninto something of inexplicable value.",
        "Did you hear it, fluting and whistling\na shrill dark music,",
        "You do not have to be good.",
        "yet I turn back\nTo sort the weeping ruins of my house:",
        "Whatever the subject, the morning sun\nglimmers it.",
        "And Him, somewhere, ponderously lifting another world,\nsetting it free to spin, if it can,\nin a darkness you can\u2019t imagine.",
        "and for every person\nthe body glowing inside the clothes\nlike a light.",
        "Dim with arthritis, time, the muddied seasons,\nGrandmother poised in the back seat again,\nCounting the cows.",
        "the hundreds of ribs\nhoused in their smooth, white\nsleeves of muscle moving it\nlike a happiness\ntoward the water, where some bubbles\non the surface of that underworld announced\na fatal carelessness.",
        "and truly it seemed\nsurprised by the unexpected kindness of the air and\nlight-hearted to be\nflying at last.",
        "Airy and shapeless thing,\nit needs\nthe metaphor of the body,\nlime and appetite,\nthe oceanic fluids;",
        "Later\nI opened his body and separated\nthe flesh from the bones\nand ate him.",
        "Some cows drank from a creek, and lurched away.",
        "and then,\nlike three tosses of silvery water,\nthey were gone.",
        "I was standing\nat the edge of the field\u2014",
        "Cold now.\nClose to the edge. Almost unbearable.",
        "it becomes\na trickle sharp as a hair that you follow\nfrom the honey pot over the table",
        "Well, who doesn\u2019t want the sun after the long winter?",
        "Surely\na beast might be clever, be lucky, move quietly\nthrough the woods for years, learning to stay away\nfrom roads and houses.",
        "Shelter in winter that day\u2014\na storm coming, but in the lee\nof an island in a cover with friends\u2014\noh, little bright cup of sun.",
        "what is it I might say\nthere in the orange light of early morning,\nin the owl\u2019s resting time,\nthat would have any pluck and worth in it?\u2014",
        "I think of the blueberry fields, the blackberry tangles,\nthe cranberry bogs.",
        "And the sky\nwith its new moon, its familiar star-trails,\nburns down like a brand-new heaver,",
        "Likely I visited all\nthe shimmering, heart-stabbing\nquestions without answers\nbefore I climbed down.",
        "You aren\u2019t much, I said\none day to my reflection\nin a green pond,\nand grinned.",
        "and, after all,\neven if we came by some miracle\nupon a language which we both knew,",
        "But to tell the truth after a while I'm pale with longing\nfor their thick bodies ruckled with lichen",
        "But his big, round music, after all,\nis too breathy to last.",
        "and, being the color of snow, catching the sun\nso they were, in part at least, golden.",
        "Farms to both sides shook, bankrupt, in the wind.",
        "Later the darkness fell\nand the solid moon\nlike a white pond rose.\nBut I wasn\u2019t in any hurry.",
        "Wherever I am, the world comes after me.",
        "They're tired of sleep.\nThey have a new idea.\nThey want to swim away\ninto the world.",
        "and then,\nlike three tosses of silvery water,\nthey were gone.",
        "over and over announcing your place\nin the family of things.",
        "But they did this\nwith no small amount of desperation\u2014you might say: love.",
        "Times in the morning early\nwhen it rained and the long gray\nbuildings came forward from darkness\noffering their windows for light.",
        "until the white snow is written upon\nin large, exuberant letters,",
        "it becomes\na trickle sharp as a hair that you follow\nfrom the honey pot over the table",
        "It had taken the hook.",
        "It could float, of course,\nbut would rather\nplumb rough matter.",
        "each pond with its\nblazing lilies\nis a prayer heard and answered\nlavishly,\nevery morning,",
        "and to fly, for the first time,\nin their sea-green helmets,\nwith brisk, metallic tails\u2014",
        "And in the evening\nthe piled firewood shifts a little,\nlonging to be on its way.",
        "She steps into the dark swamp\nwhere the long wait ends.",
        "Out of pain,\nand pain, and more pain\nwe feed this feverish plot, we are nourished\nby the mystery.",
        "as we glide\nOver the final jutting mountainside,\nAcross the suburbs tangled in their lights,",
        "The ants bore into the peony bud and there is a dark\npinprick well of sweetness.",
        "and every pond,\nno matter what its\nname is, is\nnameless now.",
        "and at night\nlights up the deep and wondrous\ndrownings of the body\nlike a star.",
        "And did you see it, finally, just under the clouds\u2014",
        "like a white candle\u2014\nor a man, in the distance,\nin the clasp of some meditation\u2014",
        "Under the orange\nsticks of the sun\nthe heaped\nashes of the night\nturn into leaves again\nand fasten themselves to the high branches\u2014",
        "this isn't\na contest but the doorway\ninto thanks,",
        "And have you too finally figured out what beauty is for?",
        "he has an idea,\nand slowly it unfolds\nfrom under his beating wings\nas long as he stays awake.",
        "motionless\nin those dark halls of honey.",
        "I think of this every morning\nas the east begins\nto tear off its many clouds\nof darkness,",
        "The domed head rose above the water, white\nas a spill of milk.",
        "Some cows drank from a creek, and lurched away.",
        "Meditation is old and honorable, so why should I\nnot sit, every morning of my life, on the hillside,\nlooking into the shining world?",
        "Nobody could count all of them\u2014",
        "One evening\nI met the mango.",
        "And settled softly on the earth once more\nRise in the fierce assumption of our lives\u2014",
        "I would like to write a poem about the world that has in it\nnothing fancy.\nBut it seems impossible.",
        "and died\nin the slow pouring off\nof rainbows.",
        "I slept as never before, a stone on the river bed,\nnothing between me and the white fire of the stars\nbut my thoughts,",
        "it becomes\na trickle sharp as a hair that you follow\nfrom the honey pot over the table",
        "So fancy is the world, who knows,\nmaybe the stars sing too,",
        "Wherever it was\nI was supposed to be\nthis morning\u2014",
        "Once, in the south,\nI had this happen:\nthe soft rope of a water moccasin\nslid down the red knees\nof a mangrove,",
        "It is always underfoot,\nlike a summons,\ngravel-backed and mossy,\nin every beetled basin\u2014",
        "an invisible line\nupon which their iridescence caught fire\nas the sun caught them, sliding down.",
        "sponging up and reflecting,\nso brilliantly,\nas it has for centuries,\nthe sun's fire."
