        "Look at Athens and Sparta. Athens was an open city and Sparta kicked people out. Go and look at the ruins of Athens and Sparta now and ask which of the two cities made the greatest contribution to civilisation. @BorisJohnson",
        "If we left the EU, we would end this sterile debate, and we would have to recognise that most of our problems are not caused by \u201cBwussels\u201d @BorisJohnson",
        "It is hard to think of a measure that the Government could have brought to the House that I could support more unreservedly and with greater pleasure than this Bill to expand the European Union. @BorisJohnson",
        "London is the most commercially important city in Europe, and it's the most populous city. It should be for the whole of the European continent what New York is to America. That's what it should be. @BorisJohnson",
        "This is a market on our doorstep, ready for further exploitation by British firms: the membership fee seems rather small for all that access. @BorisJohnson",
        "Leaving would cause at least some business uncertainty, while embroiling the Government for several years in a fiddly process of negotiating new arrangements, so diverting energy from the real problems of this country @BorisJohnson",
        "I would vote to stay in the single market. I'm in favour of the single market. I want us to be able to trade freely with our European friends and partners. @BorisJohnson",
        "There may be a risk that international companies and funds could be put off from investing in the UK by the notion that Britain has somehow cut itself off from a giant European market. @BorisJohnson",
        "Britain is a great nation, a global force for good. It is surely a boon for the world and for Europe that she should be intimately engaged in the EU. @BorisJohnson",
        "There is a risk that leaving the EU will be globally interpreted as a narrow, xenophobic, backward-looking thing to do. @BorisJohnson",
        "I believe in the free market of services and all those things. @BorisJohnson",
        "No one seems worried about the UK\u2019s EU referendum. They are smart enough to know that Britain will remain, whatever happens, in a European free-trade zone. @BorisJohnson",
        "Look at Athens and Sparta. Athens was an open city and Sparta kicked people out. Go and look at the ruins of Athens and Sparta now and ask which of the two cities made the greatest contribution to civilisation. @BorisJohnson",
        "If we get to this campaign, I would be well up for trying to make the positive case for some of the good things that have come from the single market @BorisJohnson",
        "My ideal world is, we're there, we're in the EU, trying to make it better. @BorisJohnson",
        "I'm one of the politicians willing to stand up for immigration @BorisJohnson",
        "It is in Britain\u2019s geo-strategic interests to be pretty intimately engaged in the doings of a continent that has a grim 20th-century history, and whose agonies have caused millions of Britons to lose their lives. @BorisJohnson",
        "We can\u2019t leave Europe. We\u2019re part of the European Continent. What is the English Channel? It\u2019s a primeval river that got slightly too big @BorisJohnson",
        "I\u2019m probably about the only politician I know of who is actually willing to stand up and say that he\u2019s pro-immigration. @BorisJohnson",
        "I always came down in favour, narrowly, of staying. @BorisJohnson",
        "I am not by any means an ultra-Eurosceptic. In some ways, I am a bit of a fan of the European Union. If we did not have one, we would invent something like it. @BorisJohnson",
        "There are tangible benefits to our membership of the European Union. @BorisJohnson",

        "It is hard to think of a measure that the Government could have brought to the House that I could support more unreservedly and with greater pleasure than this Bill to expand the European Union. @BorisJohnson",
        "Together with Nato the European Community, now Union, has helped to deliver a period of peace and prosperity for its people as long as any since the days of the Antonine emperors. @BorisJohnson",
        "Suppose Britain voted tomorrow to come out. We'd still have huge numbers of staff trying to monitor what was going, only we wouldn't have any vote at all. Now I don't think that's actually a prospect that's likely to appeal. @BorisJohnson",
        "There is a risk that leaving the EU will be globally interpreted as a narrow, xenophobic, backward-looking thing to do. @BorisJohnson",
