        "@dangergirl101 I just hate we are stuck on the same storyline. That's dragging about Poussey that to us happened a year ago and whole season is a few days",
        "@dangergirl101 It's still a good season and every episode makes you want to watch the next. But just last season in my opinion raised the bar.",
        "Can't believe #BB19 is one week away. That means from now until Christmas I'll be sitting on my couch cuz #survivor after.",
        "@dangergirl101 I watched this season in 2 days and it's my least favorite. If I wanna watch 24 I'll watch 24. Last season was my favorite. #OITNB5",
        "Lets be honest with ourselves. #NashvillePredators color concept always sucked. Cool logo but all yellow sucked #nhl",
        "@emilyelegado Do you get residuals?",
        "And that married couple... I always thought they should have done an #InkMaster couples season.",
        "They should have brought the twins from last season. Would have been interested in seeing them worn together #InkMaster",
        "@ArdaOcalTV But I feel like the Senators should have objected this.",
        "@TorontoPearson @CanBorder I don't give 2 craps about them you guys messed up my schedule. Was supposed to make a quick pickup an hour ago #pearsonairport",
        "@TorontoPearson hey monkeys whats with the delays? My parents have been stuck for over an hour while the plane has landed. #pearsonairport",
        "@dangergirl101 Definitely. A network with a theme. Like HGTV.",
        "@dangergirl101 Yeah and it was known as The First Network for Men or something. The Paramount Network sounds too Hollywood.",
        "@dangergirl101 Yeah The Paramount Network. First it was The Nashville Network then The National Network.",
        "@dangergirl101 Spike has made a lot of weird decisions in the past too. Dating back to their TNN days.",
        "@dangergirl101 Yeah I heard of it. Some said it was less drama and focussed on the art. But I only had time for one show.",
        "@dangergirl101 Like Christian was a \"newbie\" on season 7 but has over 15 years of Experience.",
        "@dangergirl101 Oh I never watched it. None of them are actually newbies in tattooing. They're just newbies on the show.",
        "@dangergirl101 But honestly a few newbies seem talented this season compared to season 7. Also a few duds of returning players.",
        "@dangergirl101 @mattobaugh I'm actually hoping @DJTambe and that other guy (joking) @bubbairwin make it to finale. They were there from the beginning.",
        "@dangergirl101 Yeah like Matt (who's on this season) and Kelly from last season getting eliminated before showing their finale tattoos. Ridiculous.",
        "@dangergirl101 #InkMaster is one of those shows you can enjoy watching but can also enjoy criticizing all day. Especially on their train wreck finales.",
        "@dangergirl101 Question is how can you have a fan favorite and talent like Tommy Helms and not feature him throughout the season? #InkMaster",
        "@dangergirl101 At least Season 7 they had a theme. They went from order of seasons in reverse for returning artists. From Saint Marq to Vaughan #InkMaster",
        "Damn watched The Founder with Michael Keaton. I feel like #boycott #McDonalds",
        "I don't get when an HOH puts 2 people up not in his alliance and think they have power to send them home. It's up to the house #BB19",
        "I hate to say this but this was probably my favorite episode. More drama more good tv #BB19",
        "Wow Paul really is the puppet master #BB19",
        "It's interesting how this was the most dramatic/explosive week yet it's also a \"reset\" week #BB19",

        "@ryan_connolly Weird, it only showed Monday, Thursday for last week and then Monday and iPhone one today.",
        "@ryan_connolly I wrote this before the iPhone episode which was released today.",
        "@MattCarterMedia Might as well make King of Queens with their 2 children. 1 Asian adopted girl and I think their biological boy. Rather watch that.",
        "@MattCarterMedia So it can be a a complete King of Queens rip off.",
        "@MattCarterMedia I'm fine with killing off a character but bringing in Leah full time is stupid. Why don't they bring Jerry Stiller while we are at it",
        "Hey @ryan_connolly weren't we supposed to get 3 #filmriot episodes last week?",
        "Has anyone mentioned that Cody and @jeffschroeder23  kinda look alike? #BB19",
        "What is the details of Jessica's Temptations? Does she name the replacement nominees or the HOH does? #BB19",
        "Question: why didn't Ramses get a chance to compete in this temptation then if Jess accepted last week? #bb19",
        "3 times @YouTube 3 times today keeps crashing since you changed the site @TeamYouTube #YouTube",

        "10 more minutes until #InkMaster  only reason I like Tuesdays #TattooTuesday",
        "@KristiWonk @kizgold That's why she was the last to be eliminated.",
        "@KristiWonk @kizgold Not denying it's tough.. especially after having any kind of surgery. But I felt that thing may have helped her balance herself",
        "@Catmanic1 @kizgold Well it's irrelevant now. Just saw Jessica won it.",
        "@kizgold But this resting. I still haven't seen the ending of the episode so no idea who won it. But one leg is rested do helps balance #BB19",
        "I don't think it's fair Christmas is competing in this HOH. She has one leg balanced. #BB19",
        "Why do people getting eliminated from an HOH comp get to give a punishment? They're rewarded for sucking? #BB19",
        "Watching Sundays episode.... So are the whole house now villains and Cody and Jessica the good guys? #BB19",
        "Finally catching up on BB Battleback. Sorry to see Jillian go. Not a good player but really cute #BB19",
        "Conspiracy Theory... #BBCAN6 was never cancelled and this was all a publicity stunt.",

        "Is it just me or does Mark look like he got kicked in the balls Everytime he walks? #BB19",
        "@dangergirl101 @MattCarterMedia I don't think he wants anything to do with that show. He even refused to go to finale.",
        "@dangergirl101 @MattCarterMedia James Danger was another person who for screwed. I think producers planted that canvas Natalie.",
        "@dangergirl101 @MattCarterMedia It could have been an interview with you or another article I found online. It was back in 2012.",
        "@dangergirl101 @MattCarterMedia He said in an interview that he was cast because he had no tattoos.",
        "@dangergirl101 @MattCarterMedia Should always being experts on those challenged to criticise it.",
        "@dangergirl101 @MattCarterMedia If you notice artists get heavily criticized on American Traditional or Japanese cuz Oliver and Nunez are experts on it.",
        "@dangergirl101 @MattCarterMedia In my opinion S4 had a lot of duds but probably the strongest final 4.",
        "@dangergirl101 @MattCarterMedia Yeah Jamie Davies. But I think he got some tattoos now.  At least something on his wristor forearm.",
        "@dangergirl101 @MattCarterMedia Master vs Apprentice had head to head challenge first episode and it was blind judging. Was perfect.",
        "@dangergirl101 @MattCarterMedia Remember when Melissa got eliminated S4 at the Final5 despite having a better tattoo then Scott? said it's becuz of her lack of  experience",
        "@dangergirl101 @MattCarterMedia House of Monkey may never have been at the bottom but they were still at the bottom half",
        "@dangergirl101 @MattCarterMedia I rather see blind judging on the show.  A lot of times they rely on report cards or artists reputation.",
        "Art is so subjective. I liked the art by that couple. Yet Hobo wanted to take is eye out. #InkMaster",
        "I like how the newbies can tell which vets suck #InkMaster",

        "@citrusmedia Looks cool!",

        "@ArdaOcalTV @GameOfThrones Enjoy #nationalicecreamday",
        "Congratulations Cody... You just won the participation award! #bb19",

        "Just started watching the #MayweatherMcGregor fight",
        "@MattCarterMedia Which is why I kinda feel like I'm watching BB18 all over again. Not a fan of Paul coming back or giving him the same twist from BBCAN 5",
        "@MattCarterMedia Maybe. But Jason is clearly a fool and it's hard to root for him. He would have been the target if he wasn't HOH.",
        "@MattCarterMedia Not a Jason fan but yeah stunned by Cody #1",
        "@MattCarterMedia Plus when you look at Jokers ranking the current HG are all at the bottom in color and the top is all back and white.",
