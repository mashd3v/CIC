        "13/ As more allocators spend more time in crypto, I would not take it for granted that everyone will recognize that Bitcoin is the one and only hardest money, and that everything else is just children's toys\n\nGood luck pitching the pyramid scheme to the board\n\n{fin}",
        "12/ But wait, there is no strict reason why the underlying platform should accrue value, even if tremendous value is tokenized on top\n\nYes, but all cryptocurrencies receive the ~98% of Bitcoin's hard money properties \"for free\" because of the beauty of public key cryptography",
        "11/ What's the narrative that causes asset allocators to say \"Holy shit, at $10T, crypto is *dramatically undervalued* because [some platform] is on a clear path to tokenize *all of the world's value*",
        "10/ The latter resonates.\n\nLet's fast forward a few years when crypto is worth $10T. Larger than gold. A lot of money starts to wonder \"how much bigger can this get than gold? It's neo-gold sure, but gold has been around for 2000+ years!\"",
        "9/ The other answer is \"All of the capital in the world - currency, real estate, bonds, equity, commodities, and equity - will be tokenized, as tokenization is *the right way* to manage value ownership and transfer. The TAM is ~$250-500T depending on how you count\"",
        "8/ One answer is \"dapps, web3, and a ton of amazing things you can't even imagine yet. It's the next Internet!\"\n\nThis is a pretty poor argument IMO, but it does resonate with some. I don't care for it because it anchors too heavily on the Internet without justifying that anchor",
        "7/ These asset managers often ask\n\n\"You say this stuff can be worth $50T+. What possible story can justify that valuation beyond just digital gold (aka pyramid)?\"\n\nI think there are only two plausible answers, and one of them is pretty loose",
        "6/ You can argue that this is missing the bigger picture - about how you denominate wealth to begin with - but there are *a lot* of asset managers and UHNWI individuals who believe in investing in things that are efficient --&gt; improve productivity in the macro economic sense",
        "5/ Perhaps the ultimate manifestation of this world view is Buffet, who *rails* on gold. His rant goes something like this\n\nYou can take all the gold in the world and put it in a room. 10 years later, it will have sat there, and not produced any value. Gold is therefore worthless",
        "4/ About half of them \"get\" the hard money / digital gold narrative\n\nThe other half, not so much\n\nThey basically call out Bitcoin for what it is: a pyramid scheme!\n\nThen they ask why they should invest in a pyramid scheme?",
        "3/ For those of you reading this on twitter, recognize the tremendous selection bias at play: that you even follow me on Twitter\n\nIn the last few months, I've been talking to the CIOs of a lot of major endowments and pensions who collectively manage trillions in assets\n\nTrillions",
        "2/ In order for Bitcoin to work, Bitcoin *must* be evangelized\n\nFor a given evangelist, the process goes like this\n\na) learn about Bitcoin\nb) buy bitcoin\nc) tell everyone else to buy Bitcoin, and that all other cryptos are nonsense\n\nCan't get more pyramid than that",
        "1/ Bitcoin maximalists rightly espouse Bitcoin as the best, hardest money every devised. They recognize Bitcoin's for its strengths.\n\nAnd they're right",
        "0/ Bitcoin is *by definition* a pyramid scheme / multi-level marketing scheme\n\nTo be fair, it's the most \"fair\" and egalitarian pyramid scheme ever devised, but it is none the less a pyramid scheme",
        "3/ Another counter is that LTC is faster than BTC because of its 2.5 minute block time. If you want fast blocks, you can use literally anything that's not Bitcoin: ETH, ZEC, XMR, XLM, XRP, etc\n\nAlso, payments use case is stupid for long term value retention (velocity problem)",
        "2/ If you buy LTC so you can convert to BTC.... then you just sold the LTC you bought... sounds like the velocity problem to me!\n\nFor the uninitiated, see here - https://t.co/gXqi1IHqSj",
        "1/ The general theme of these counter arguments is that we don't understand that lightning can work across BTC and LTC, and that LTC can help onboard users to lightning\n\nLet's say that does turn out to be true. What then?",
