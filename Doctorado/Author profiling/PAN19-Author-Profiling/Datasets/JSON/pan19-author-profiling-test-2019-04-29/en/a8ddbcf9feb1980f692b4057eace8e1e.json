        "3/ As founders, Jack and Stan have blown us away. They are one of the most well rounded teams in the space, bringing decades of operational experience in tech startups to crypto. They know how to execute: raise money, recruit, define product vision, deliver on a schedule, etc",
        "2/ We've spoken to a number of teams in this space, and found that Jack and Stan had the clearest vision not only for how to implement the EVM on plasma, but how to build a robust network of chains that can deliver a powerful network effect",
