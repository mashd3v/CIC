        "@Millar_Colin @JackRathborn Don't think that's the case this time around. Just genuinely think a few of those players aren't up to the standard of a top team",
        "@thehuwdavies I don't think they are in this case. Just think quite a few of them aren't good enough for a top team. Conte's negativity hasn't helped either, but I think he's just been worn out by the incompetence of a directionless board",
        "@No1isChelsea This is exactly it. The club can't continue with this short-termism. It's sucking the life out of the team",
        "Chelsea are a leadership club who willingly sack managers, sign bang average players, ignore the best youth academy in the country and have no long-term plan. Why on Earth would Hazard and Courtois extend contracts for that?",
        "Surely Chelsea have an academy midfielder or two who would do a better job than Danny Drinkwater?",
        "@_BenWills Not if Luis Enrique is in charge",
        "@tehTrunk Probably wouldn't start ahead of Son tbh",
        "If he hasn't contemplated it already, this 90 minutes could push Hazard over the edge and fully convince him to leave Chelsea",
        "@TheBlairNewman It's sickening really. If this Napoli can't win it from Juve, then who can? Worrying",
        "You can tell by the devastation amongst the Napoli fans in the stadium that they know it too",
        "Well, that's Juve's 7th title in a row anyway",
        "@under_thecosh It's why they never win anything",
