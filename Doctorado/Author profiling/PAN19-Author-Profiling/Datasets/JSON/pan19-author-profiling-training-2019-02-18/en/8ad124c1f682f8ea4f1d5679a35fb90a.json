        "The article in question. They didn\u2019t \u201cinvent\u201d taxes, they\u2019re rivaling them and patching a hole that current political structures have not addressed. It may be tempting to laugh, but there\u2019s something bigger going on here. #watch #flagwavinginthewind #analyze #thewaterweswim https://t.co/1MdfnQSeyt",
        "What is being debated and decided matters, but the structures matter more. If you learn of new and exciting models and examples of businesses and governments, please share. We need to te-think these systems. /peace",
        "The trouble with leaving it to the tech companies or to commercial industries in general however, is that it cuts down on accessibility. Pay for it, or leave - and the economic gap widens. But what if we had more social businesses? If enterprises were lead by other metrics?",
        "Is my party against your party truly the best way to get anything done? I don\u2019t think so. Is there a large gap between the idea of paying taxes and getting things done for \u201cus\u201d in the way we would like to, and the way that things currently are? I think so.",
        "Liquid democracy offers an option to this, but isn\u2019t a whole picture. Every few days, I watch politicians battle not only each other (in a very theatrical way), but also battle the structure in which they are supposed to interact.",
        "How do we put a face, a story, and a reasonable weight of importance while voting, deciding and implementing laws or systems that will disproportionately affect some and not others?",
        "For example, we seem to do quite well with building connection and empathy face to face. How can we facilitate this between at risk communities, who are most likely to be affected by laws done about them, for example?",
        "Inversely, how can we hack our own systems, so as to minimize the chances of such \u201cevil\u201d occurring? We have reflexes programmed in as the result of millions of years of evolution, most not \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d, but simply characteristics.",
        "We ought to also define \u201charm\u201d. The only thing needed for great harm to happen seems to, most often, be for people to not have focus in one area, in favour of another. There\u2019s also intentional harm, but it isn\u2019t as common and conscious as most of us assume in \u201cevil\u201d or \u201charm\u201d.",
        "They will always be changing, in response to technological evolutions, but it would be worthwhile to build in anticipation of the dynamics of power itself. What are some common pitfalls, once an entity harnesses enough power? What does it take to cause harm?",
        "We\u2019d be crazy to think that those abuses won\u2019t happen again. I\u2019d be really interested in having corruption experts and historians chime in on the creation of those types of technological safeguards.",
        "As we\u2019re finding out with the giants - Facebook, Google, Apple - it also is at the cost of our privacy. This is a problem in our relationship to both businesses and government. Where are the safeguards against abuses? How will we minimize the effect that corruption can have?",
        "The difference with these seems to be that you vote with you dollar, but we\u2019re all kidding ourselves if we say that that\u2019s not already happening in government. We\u2019ve (to a certain extent) separated church and state, but we haven\u2019t separated state and money.",
        "A lot of people are making fun of a \u201cneighbourhood pools their money\u201d app, saying techies \u201cinvented\u201d taxes. Thing is, we are entering a time when tech companies can do things faster and better than much of our governments, but at what cost? https://t.co/ulnDsWAxDb",
