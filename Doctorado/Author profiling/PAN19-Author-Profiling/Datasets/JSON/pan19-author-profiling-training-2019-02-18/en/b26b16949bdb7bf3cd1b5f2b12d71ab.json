        "So the inevitable result of Janus, RtW laws, governors attacking union rights is more strikes. Take away the political route and workers will be left with the industrial one. It\u2019s already happening in WV, OK, elsewhere. It\u2019s not about salaries, it\u2019s about having a voice (end).",
        "Bosses will be willing to spend much more than cost of settling a contract to fight unionization because it\u2019s about power, not money, and the power to set conditions unilaterally. You can\u2019t put a figure on fairness.",
        "Second, for politicians, union rights aren\u2019t just about money. Public workers are like other workers. They want fairness, they want to not be subjected to arbitrary whims of bosses, they want a say in what they do for 8+ hours a day.",
        "By abrogating right to strike, unions have to rely on politics, and the Democratic Party, to get what they want. As I argue, this makes union rights a partisan issue and makes unions a fat target for the GOP https://t.co/itKLk1wl8i",
        "First for unions, CB laws are double edged sword. They establish rights but also constrain unions, which effectively must abrogate right to strike. Unions give up an important tool of leverage, which got them the CB laws in first place.",
        "Fact that collective bargaining laws by themselves fail to have significant impact on both teacher compensation and public budgets highlights a few truths for both unions and politicians:",
        "Republican governors like Scott Walker sell their attacks on public sector unions, which are obviously motivated by politics, as motivated by budgetary concerns. Smash unions, save taxpayer money. Also false.",
        "This is one of the key arguments of the #Janus plaintiffs. During oral arguments, Anthony Kennedy\u2019s comments indicated he believes weakening public sector unions is an intrinsic good because unions bloat the size of government, which is false.",
        "However the findings more directly contradict conservative anti-union narrative: that public sector unions expand the size of bureaucracy and increase their own capture of public resources at taxpayer expense. https://t.co/m8K9JOYVF1",
        "Politico\u2019s summary is a little misleading; highlights part of the paper that contradicts one part of the unions\u2019 narrative, that collective bargaining is necessary to raise teacher pay https://t.co/bjUJvnulGP",

        "At the time, the Panama Canal Treaty was controversial and Carter was lambasted for it by Republicans, notably Jesse Helms, though he simply inherited the process from Nixon/Ford. Today, the treaty dispute is an anachronism. No one cares now except Trump.",
        "The US did not give the Canal to Panama out of charity, Panama won it through deadly protests, years of negotiations beginning under LBJ, and ultimately the Torrijos-Carter treaty. Panama has run it very well officially since 1999, and effectively before.",
        "This is a huge insult to a country for whom the canal, and Panama\u2019s successful operation and expansion of it is an emblem of national pride.",
