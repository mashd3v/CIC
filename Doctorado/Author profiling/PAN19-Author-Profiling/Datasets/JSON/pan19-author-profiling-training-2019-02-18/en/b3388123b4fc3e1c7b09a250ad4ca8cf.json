        "I had a lot of fun, Tenma.",
        "I don't really know. I got acquainted with them a little while earlier and they let me join the team.",
        "Ancient Dark's strong point is perceiving the enemy's movements and taking away their power!",
        "Now, let's begin training for Avatar Armed.",
        "Axe of the Demon Lord!",
        "Tenma.. I'm sorry.",
        "Unless you're strong, you're worth nothing!",
        "Leave them to me.",
        "If you were there that time, maybe things would have been different.",
        "Black Ash!",
        "We won't lose!",
        "You guys were run to the ground and beaten. I can't forgive that..",
        "Aha, you really are interesting.",
        "If you want to get stronger on this island, I'll help you.",
        "My name is Shuu. It's nice to meet you.",
        "This island used to hold matches that were similar to soccer.",
        "Yeah, let's end this.",
        "This island may be cursed.. By soccer.",
        "I have to stay and protect this island. It's a really important job.",
        "So you have some skill.",
        "Listen up! I've decided that you are free to use this forest.",
        "Calling it a god is a little over the top..",
        "Hakuryuu!",
        "Um.. Well, it's because you guys are interesting! Especially you.",
        "I have to stay and protect this island. It's a really important job.",
        "Hakuryuu.. I wonder what kind of soccer we truly hoped for in the depths of our hearts.",
        "Hi.",
        "Not bad, Tenma. Impressive.",
        "Yep. You're interesting.",
        "You want to use Avatar Armed, don't you?",
        "Wondeba. Join me and Tenma together!",
        "Yes, I guess you could say that.",
        "To tell you the truth, I've been watching you ever since you arrived on this island.",
        "Of course not.",
        "Tenma! Calm down and examine the shape of the rocks. Then you'll be able to reach the top.",
        "Hakuryuu?!",
        "Ancient Dark's strong point is perceiving the enemy's movements and taking away their power!",
        "Tenma. I'm sure you'll come to realize it after this match.",
        "Let me say this up front so you don't get the wrong idea: I'm on this team upon my own free will.",
        "Block it!",
        "Think about what you want to protect and wish to gain even greater strength.",
        "You want to use Avatar Armed, don't you?",
        "That's why he made the other team promise to lose intentionally, quietly slipping them a token of his gratitude.",
        "My power will pull you up.",
        "But this ball is what we used long ago to decide on important matters at the time.",
        "Let's go.",
        "Guys, keep your eyes closed and listen to me. Quiet down your heart.",
        "We'll enjoy it from the depths of our hearts and win against Tenma and the others!",
        "I had a lot of fun, Tenma.",
        "One year, during a long dry spell, this ball was used to decide who should be sacrificed in order to save the village.",
        "Soccer isn't something to enjoy like you seem to think it is.",
        "Sword Excalibur!",
        "Yes, I guess you could say that.",
        "Of course not.",
        "Aha, you really are interesting.",
        "The force of those feelings will draw you and your Avatar closer.",
        "I don't really know. I got acquainted with them a little while earlier and they let me join the team.",
        "Give it up! You won't be able to do anything with your power!",
        "If only he had the conviction that he would win, and the courage to fight. Then maybe he wouldn't have done such a thing..",
        "I want to give their heightened feelings a boost.",
        "Tenma.. I'm sorry.",
        "This island used to hold matches that were similar to soccer.",
        "It does! No, it already has.",
        "You want to use Avatar Armed, don't you?",
        "Train, huh..",
        "You kind of rushed that one.",
        "You guys were run to the ground and beaten. I can't forgive that..",
        "Will you be able to protect what is precious to you?",
        "You'll definitely need Avatar Armed to fight these guys.",
        "Now, Tenma! It's time to show your own strength!",
        "Hakuryuu, should I unleash my power?",
        "But this ball is what we used long ago to decide on important matters at the time.",
        "It's... a bear?",
        "Guys, keep your eyes closed and listen to me. Quiet down your heart.",
        "Black Ash!",
        "I want you to get an understanding of Avatar Armed on this island.",
        "If you want to get stronger on this island, I'll help you.",
        "Yeah, let's end this.",
        "She was sacrificed. He couldn't protect his own sister.",
        "Imagine your Avatar surrounding your whole body, much like a wind that wraps around you. The wind on this island wants to be one with you.",
        "Alright. If you win against us in soccer, I'll allow it.",
        "If you were there that time, maybe things would have been different.",
        "How about we enjoy our own soccer?",
        "He bought the match with money, but then the villagers found out.",
        "Now, let's begin training for Avatar Armed.",
        "Think about what you want to protect and wish to gain even greater strength.",
        "Raimon is just stronger than we thought. That's all.",
        "You guys were run to the ground and beaten. I can't forgive that..",
        "Soccer isn't something to enjoy like you seem to think it is.",
        "I had a lot of fun, Tenma.",
        "No.",
        "The force of those feelings will draw you and your Avatar closer.",
        "Tenma. I'm sure you'll come to realize it after this match.",
        "Feel that? The wind is coming.",
        "Hakuryuu!",
        "Yep. You're interesting.",
        "I want you to get an understanding of Avatar Armed on this island.",
        "Give it up! You won't be able to do anything with your power!",
        "Um.. Well, it's because you guys are interesting! Especially you.",
        "With that weak soccer..?"
