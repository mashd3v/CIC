        "Being a writer: long periods of silence, broken up by occasional bursts of this. (It's a blank video; sorry \u2014\u00a0I don't know how to put just audio on Twitter.) #mechanicalkeyboard https://t.co/9FOpRPbX7g",
        "Benchmarks for the new iPad Pros look\u2026 impressive. Excessive, even. You don't put that kind of grunt into anything but a full-time, serious computing device. https://t.co/Q5DPCVoJPR",
        "2. Last, but by no means least, the most valuable piece of writing advice you'll ever see\u2026\n\nBackup your goddamned work regularly. Not on the same computer. Don't keep backups in the same physical location. If you lose it all, it's your own fault.\n\nThank you. Good luck! \ud83d\udc4d",
        "1. Don't question whether you're a writer. There's no entrance exam, nor should there be. Writers write. There are far more people who think they're writers and aren't, because they're not in the chair and hitting the keys. I hereby bestow writerhood upon you. Now that's done.",
        "But the general baseline advice is: write first, edit later. You can edit crap, but you can't edit nothing. If you're in real trouble, go ahead and skip forward to sketch out a scene you're dying to write. That's still progress.\n\nTwo final pieces of advice, most important of all.",
        "Try not to edit while you're writing; again, \"while\". If you get a good routine going, some people (me!) find it helpful to re-read just yesterday's words each morning, and do a light edit. I then backfill any research stuff. Then, in the afternoon, I actually write.",
        "If you're really having trouble, look at it a different way. What I do is, instead of thinking \"What happens next?\", I instead ask myself \"What's the next thing I _need_ to happen?\". Figure out the waypoints ahead, then see if the path between is clearer (virtually always).",
        "Try writing at the same time each day, in the same place. It can help. Also try stopping each day when you have a very strong sense of what comes next; jot down a couple of bullet points instead of the prose, and you've got an easy start the next day. It's half the battle.",
        "If you haven't made them in advance, make them as you go. As you invent biographical info or personal characteristics (for people), or relevant ambient detail (places), update the sheets. You'll thank yourself a hundred times later when you refer back to them.",
        "There's a specific kind-of exception to the no-researching rule, and it's this: use your sheets. You should have one Character Sheet per major character (\"faces\"), and one Location Sheet per major location (\"places\"). Might be a city or a single building.",
        "A good placeholder is something that'll never occur in the text. Nonsense is fine, like YYYYY or whatever, but ideally use metadata, like a comment in Word, Scrivener, or Ulysses. Bonus points if your app can give you a quick list of just those things later, and jump to them.",
        "Don't do research while writing. Note that I said \"while\"; I mean don't be writing, then stop to look something up, then continue. You'll wreck your momentum. If you do nothing else, invent a placeholder that means \"FILL THIS IN LATER\", and use it.",

        "That said, I do highly recommend outlining. Broad strokes first, then iteratively refine until you're sick of doing so. I usually go down to the granularity of groups of a few scenes, and sometimes further. I also recommend reading about the three-act structure.",
        "One common way to categorise writers is those who plan/outline first (planners), and those who just wing it (pantsers). I'm a planner, so really I'd say: hey, plan a lot before you start. But it's already 1st November, so I'm a bit late with that advice.",

        "@four_sides The effect of a sale is also at least 95% due to promotion, not price; a price drop alone has negligible impact, though it's proportional to ranking, so it's self-reinforcing. It also varies by category/genre, etc. There are a lot of moving parts.",
