        "@Mamaofabean This has less to do with policing her behavior and more to do with judging how the ump handled this call. Apply the exact same standard to male tennis players &amp; I have no problem with the call. But this isn\u2019t the case at all.",
        "@Mamaofabean I feel ZERO conflict here.",
        "@Mamaofabean Fuck that. Plenty of male tennis players behave like this all the time &amp; aren\u2019t penalized for it. It\u2019s a clear double standard. Applied more harshly always for women (especially women of colour). Joe MacEnroe was a classic example of shit attitude. This didn\u2019t happen to him.",

        "@Mamaofabean Why don\u2019t you ask the umps who\u2019ve been threatened by male players over the decades of men\u2019s tennis. Maybe you\u2019ll find you answer there.",
        "@Mamaofabean I said it\u2019s \u201clike\u201d, I didn\u2019t say you said it. But frankly, the comparison holds. Blaming those who stand up for their rights / victim-shaming is a slippery slope. She owes nobody any do-overs to appease their privileged sensitivities.",
        "@Mamaofabean Sure the situation was overall hard for everyone. But I will *always* prioritize a person\u2019s human rights over someone else\u2019s hurt feelings. Otherwise, human rights just don\u2019t work. That\u2019s my priority.",

        "@Mamaofabean No, I can\u2019t accept that. Policing her behaviour is like suggesting women who wear short skirts had it coming when they get raped. The line for me is very clear when it comes to supporting human rights.",

        "@Mamaofabean It\u2019s unfortunate the other tennis player got caught in the crossfire, but she\u2019s not disrespecting anybody by standing up for having her human rights violated like that. She owes no apology.",
        "@Mamaofabean She wasn\u2019t disrespecting her opponent. She was sticking up for herself. If the ump didn\u2019t want so much drama in the game, he should have checked his racist sexist views before the game began. She owes no apology for standing until for her basic human rights.",

Full empathy from me.",

        "@Mamaofabean That was AFTER he treated her badly. So what. She\u2019s standing up for herself. Good for her.",
        "@Mamaofabean This is also part of the problem. She didn\u2019t \u201cthreaten\u201d anybody. She called the ump \u201ca thief\u201d for stealing a point. But people often perceive \u201cemotional black women\u201d as threatening (aka racism). No, she\u2019s deeply invested in her game &amp; upset at unfair calls. Same as male players.",
