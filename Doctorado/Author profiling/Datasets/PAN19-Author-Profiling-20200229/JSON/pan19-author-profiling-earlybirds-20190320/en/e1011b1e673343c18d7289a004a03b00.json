        "@EmerWhyte @JCforTeachers That is the ideal but the reality is different. When teachers get a Principal sitting down asking them how many Distinctions, Higher Merits etc their class got, and then asking them how they will improve on those numbers, things change.\nThis is a shame but it's the reality.",
