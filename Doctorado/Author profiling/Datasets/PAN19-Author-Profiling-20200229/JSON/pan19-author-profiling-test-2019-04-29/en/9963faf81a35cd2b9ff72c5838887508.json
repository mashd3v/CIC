        "there is still\nsomewhere deep within you\na beast shouting that the earth\nis exactly what it wanted --",
        "So fancy is the world, who knows,\nmaybe the stars sing too,",

        "how the old couple\nhad almost nothing to give\nbut their willingness\nto be attentive\u2014",
        "upon the brash\nturnip-hearted skunk cabbage\nslinging its bunches leaves up\nthrough the chilling mud.",
        "And did you see it, finally, just under the clouds --",
        "without a pinch of hope\nor a single unfulfilled desire",
        "You do not have to walk on your knees\nfor a hundred miles through the desert repenting.",
        "If I stopped\nthe pain\nwas unbearable.",

        "I can only stare.\nShe is the most beautiful woman\nI have ever seen.",
        "Something\njust now\nmoved through my heart\nlike the thinnest of blades",
        "a taste\ncomposed of everything lost, in which everything lost is found.",

        "The gospel of\nlight is the crossroads of\u2014indolence, or action.",
        "For there I am, in the mossy shadows, under the trees.",
        "So fancy is the world, who knows,\nmaybe the stars sing too,",
        "and to do this\nI will go indoors to my desk --\nI will sit in my chair --\nI will look back\ninto the lost morning",
