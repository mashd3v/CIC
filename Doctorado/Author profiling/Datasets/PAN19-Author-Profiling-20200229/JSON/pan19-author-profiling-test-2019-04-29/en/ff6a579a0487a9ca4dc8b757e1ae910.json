        "4/ Given the above, we realized that participating in this ecosystem in a meaningful capacity would be beyond the scope of an investment firm, and warranted a dedicated and independent team\n\nThis also has the benefit of allowing Tushar and myself to focus on managing capital",
        "3/ EOS is far and away the largest blockchain - in terms of usage, market cap, liquidity, and others - and requires the most active and engaged governance, and technical infrastructure",

        "5/ But the aggregate value of a system is *not* set from the top-down. It's set by buyers and sellers in an open order book from the bottom-up.\n\nThe system will only be as value-able as *marginal buyers and sellers value it*",
        "4/ As a system designer, it's natural to think about the system from the top down, and from this, it flows that a system with ideal governance (doesn't matter what ideal is for the purposes of this argument) should be value-able in aggregate",
        "3/ Now for governance\n\nYou can make the reasonable argument that governance is valuable (note that Bitcoin maximalists will disagree with this assertion) because governance allows a complex system to work in the long run to manage scarcity among a diverse, heterogenous population",
        "2/ This math works because you can value the annuity at the aggregate level, *and you can securitize it such that someone can own some fraction of the asset, and the fractional owner can also value the asset on a pro-rate basis",
        "1/ If your discount rate is 5%, you can value an annuity of $100 as $100 / 5% = $2000\n\nNow, you can take that $2000, and divy it up into say 1000 shares, each of which is worth $2\n\nEach $2 share is therefore entitled to receive $.10 / year.",
        "0/ The problem with valuing governance is a classic bottoms-up  / top-down asymmetry with regards to how to value it\n\nTo best understand this, let's consider something that can be easily valued: an annuity",

        "2/ IIRC, stake un-bonding time in Casper is 90 days. If you look at this graph, this suggests that the *highest* percentage of coins that move more frequently than once every 90 days is about 40%.\n\nThis would imply that 60% of coins could be staked at any time.",
