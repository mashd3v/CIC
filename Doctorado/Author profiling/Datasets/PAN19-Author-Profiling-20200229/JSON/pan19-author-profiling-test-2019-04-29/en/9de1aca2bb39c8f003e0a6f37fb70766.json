        "20/ However, if you have any priority other than \"withstand full frontal government assault\" then the options for security and consensus become... looser and more interesting\n\n{fin}",
        "19/ And to be clear, everything I've said above goes out the window if you assume the attacker is not economically motivated - ie a government\n\nCertainly systems like EOS are far more susceptible to such attacks than Bitcoin",
        "18/ I don't mean to dismiss the value of academically rigorous BFT consensus research. But it is worth considering how a network can bootstrap it's way to success through sheer economics",
        "17/ What's my point in all of this? To defend EOS? Not really\n\nRather, to argue that any sufficiently valuable network becomes extra-ordinarily difficult to attack in an economically profitable way.",
        "16/ Based on the back of the envelope math above, you just sit still\n\n(also, if it's a cartel, coordinating this attack is even harder as anyone can bail anytime... prisoner's dilemma)",
        "15/ So if you're a BP cartel, what do you do? Do you just sit still and collect money in a growing system, or do you try to pull off the greatest attack of all time?",
        "14/ Looking at these round numbers, it seems pretty clear that pulling off this attack profitably would be impossible today, and even still extraordinarily difficult as short markets develop",
        "13/ Today, the market cap of EOS is about $5-6B. So You'd need to short $2B of EOS\n\nAnd as the marketcap of EOS grows, the amount in $ terms that you need to short grows too",
        "12/ So in order to pull this off profitably, you'd need to get a short on 20-25% of all of EOS to break even, and then you'd probably want to be able to short another 30-40% of EOS to justify the risk\n\nOr in other words, you'd need to short 50% of EOS",
        "11/ If this BP cartel has truly cornered the market on EOS voting, that means that they collectively control/strongly influence a massive percentage of the EOS tokens. Likely somewhere on the order of 20-25% (about 45% of EOS tokens are voting today)",
        "10/ So the question facing this BP cartel is: do you short EOS and wreck the market, or do you simply collect inflation in a growing system?",
        "9/\n\nProving censorship is difficult, but possible, especially if censorship is happening at scale. Unclear how the market would react if this were to happen\n\nProducing invalid state transitions that steal people's money would almost certainly cause the price to fall off a cliff",
        "8/ Broadly speaking, they can do two things:\n\n1) censor transactions\n2) produce invalid state transitions (take your money without your consent)",
        "6/  So the real question is, what is that threshold? Is it $1B or $10B?\n\nI suspect it's somewhere in the neighborhood of $10B.\n\nLet's use EOS, which is the butt of most consensus jokes, as a though experiment",
        "5/ That at some level of scale - in the case of BTC at $100B - that attacking the network is simply not economically worth it.\n\nOf course, this doesn't mean that the network won't be attacked by soverigns who are not economically motivated",
        "4/ Now, miners could short BTC to hedge the risk and even profit on the way down, but again, they chose not to exploit the system at all\n\nSo what does this tell us?",
        "3/ The only incentive-compatible explanation for miners choosing not to exploit is that if they got caught, they expected the price of BTC to plummet so much that their investments in mining hardware would lose the substantial majority of their value\n\nOr simply ideology",
        "2/ If #2 was in the fact the case - and there's no way to prove this - then this stands as the single largest game-theoretic test in the history of crypto\n\nFor the purposes of this test, let's assume that they did know\n\nWhat does this mean? What can we extrapolate?",
        "1/ The Bitcoin CVE bug that allowed miners to violate the supply schedule, but that was never actually exploited, is an incredible case study\n\nThere are two fundamental explanations for why the bug wasn't exploited:\n\n1) no miners knew about the bug\n2) miners chose not to exploit",

        "13/ First, let's consider a factory/refinery/large scale industrial operation.\n\nThere's no need for machines to pay one another. They are all owned by the same company. No point in transferring money from your left pocket to your right pocket",
        "12/ And then there's machine to machine (M2M) payments. This one is the most vague argument that micropayment proponents make\n\n\"But there will be use cases you can't even imagine yet.\"\n\nBullshit.",
        "11/ It sounds nice in theory as each item is delivered, that that the customer pays. Eg as each of the 1M widgets arrives, pay 1/1Mth the total\n\nWhy not just pay 50% before, 50% after, and trust the counterparty who you're going to buy/sell the next 1M widgets from anyways?",
        "10/ Next let's talk about freight / b2b.\n\nWhy the hell are invoices are net30? This is mostly a function of the pre-Visa era, when payments were processed with checks. It's also a function of the fact that credit cards aren't really intended for $100K+ b2b transactions",
        "9/ Even if newspapers could have charged $.10 / article, they would have failed because competitors would've pushed the price down to $0 anyways\n\nAlso, it's too mentally expensive for consumers, even the poorest consumers, to make $.10 decisions. Nick Szabo has written about this",
        "8/ In the era of the Internet, content providers began competing with Facebook, Youtube, Netflix, and the long tail of blogs for the same amount of consumer attention",
        "7/ Paying for media online. Eg $.10 / article\n\nThe problem with online media in the age of the Internet is that their scope of competition increased 1,000,000x. In the paper era, printing presses had to be local, so competition was limited.",
        "6/ The three examples that micro-payments proponents cite are: paying for media online, net 30 b2b payments, and machine-to-machine payments\n\nLet's walk through each and debunk why they don't matter:",
        "5/ Prepaid cellphone: consumer trusts carrier to provide the minutes\nPostpaid cellphone: carrier trusts consumer to pay\nPrepaid gas: consumer trusts gas station to provide the gas\nUber: pre-auth some charge, and finalize exact amount later\nBusiness freight: pay net 30",
        "4/ In practice, society solved this hundreds of years ago through trust (aka counterparty risk) and batching of payments. Examples:",
