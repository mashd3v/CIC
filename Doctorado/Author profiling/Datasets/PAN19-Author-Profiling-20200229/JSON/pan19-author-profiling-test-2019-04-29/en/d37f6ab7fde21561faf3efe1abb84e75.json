        "@Vaphilly624 it was good but this was much better here. dynamics were way better than. people that live north and west might underestimate how many storms suck entirely or drift toward suck after starting well. that one was a sea of slush and drips downtown and melting as soon as it ended.",
        "@_WxPhil_ yeah I remember being out in it.. and I think nonsubjectively it does rank higher but this is a bit subjective. these are the top 5 for accum at DCA in my time here either way. today reminded me a bit of St Patrick's 2014 but I forget my final total would have to look.",
        "@pazzo83 @DTVaWeatherman @wall_cloud There is some argument that if you name stuff then what happens with the small unnamed thing that is terrible to some locale. Or like th  Joaquin case where it aided the pattern block up that caused SC floods but it wasn\u2019t Joaquin. Rational is a bit flimsy tho imo.",
        "@_WxPhil_ Maybe mainly I don\u2019t like wind that much. Dynamically it was more interesting... results I\u2019d take this one. But it was a crazy snowpack.",
        "@_WxPhil_ @DTVaWeatherman @wall_cloud it's true the research doesn't back up all the claims but there is also limited research. it's hard to see how it's doing damage.. calling one storm 35 different things seems worse. there are a lot of heavy biases in the field.",
        "Was thinking how this storm ranks on my 13 year DC snow list... I think it's the following. Dates and DCA numbers shown. \n\nFeb 5-6 2010 (17.8)\nDec 18-19 2009 (16.4)\nJan 22-23 2016 (17.8)\nJan 12-13 2019 (10.2)\nFeb 9-10 2010 (10.8)",
        "@DTVaWeatherman @wall_cloud already enough people making stuff up here DT\n\n1) lol\n\n2) it's in use other places and who cares it still makes it easier long term to refer to storms etc. it is intuitive.",

        "@mpierceva yeah it drops us like 30 degrees in 5 hours heh. cold should be legit.. hopefully the warming for the storm after is wrong.",
        "@storm_paglia was a good one! hard to say for sure I suppose. eventually the bulk of the trough passes a nice spot but we've already wasted most of the storm by then. could change if it's not handling the northern stream right I suppose as it helps drag the thing north.",

        "@Bscott4293 guess it can't be ruled out but there's so much warm flow out ahead of it gonna need some shifts.",
        "The next sys still looks quite hard to do right. We rarely do well when that's the case. The main upper lobe eventually passes in a nice spot but this is after warmth is dragged in along the front etc. Frontal systems are mucho tricky in this area. Potential does not mean snow.",

I wondered and tweeted at the time if it was just indicating higher potential and placing too many bands everywhere or something",
        "@stormchas4 @EricBlake12 yeah agree or people just use all models the same and blend them or something. there seems to be a lot of lacking nuance even among pros tbh. the hi rez was actually rather steady and also fairly rapidly increasing in precip through the end. n trend happens like 75% of the time.",
