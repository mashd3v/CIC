        "@dangergirl101 Yeah I'll watch it. Basically a winner gets on the next season?",
        "@dangergirl101 I enjoyed Redemption. But you don't cover it on the site?",
        "@dangergirl101 I'd rather see canvases that were unhappy. Which can lead to future Redemption episodes.",
        "@dangergirl101 I know it's ridiculous. Sometimes like Sausage won that but still lost the finale.",
        "@dangergirl101 After last night's lack of organization I expect a disaster of a finale. Don't care who wins just want something organized.",
        "@dangergirl101 It also sucks for the open canvases who technically donated their body for nothing. Yes a free tattoo but still.",
        "@dangergirl101 Actually Matt's was shown right after he got eliminated because of a tattoo he did earlier in the day. We never saw Kelly's unless online.",

        "@dangergirl101 Depressed about the fan outrage. He eliminated Kelly because \"they've seen her do this style before\" even though fans voted for all",
        "@dangergirl101 Last finale Dave Navarro disappeared off social media for a few days cuz he was depressed. I listened to him talk about it on Dark Matter",
        "@dangergirl101 Yes, common sense always takes a vacation that day.",
        "@dangergirl101 Finale judging is a whole other show that we expect to be a disaster as always.",
        "@dangergirl101 Not denying that. They made It sound that they would get judged by 2nd tattoo and Black Cobra with their first. #inkmaster",
        "@dangergirl101 this episode made no sense. Basically Black Cobra Tattoo got a day to relax for not getting picked #inkmaster",
        "Sad to see @TommyHelmArt  and Empire State Tattoo get eliminated but I'm still rooting for Old Town Ink. #inkmaster",
        "WTF? So basically Black Cobra Tattoo got a day to relax??? #InkMaster",
        "Why would Golden Skull Tattoo or even the Alien Mary people want to be picked? They could have easily won #InkMaster",
        "That's not right. Giving them only 4 canvases and if not picked you are up for elimination. #InkMaster",
        "Ha! Matt and Katie screwed themselves by recommending every artist and they ended up getting stuck with the worst canvas #InkMaster",

        "@pamelammars I think something may have happened and she over exaggerated the disorders but to the point where she may believe it.",
        "@pamelammars I've seen the list of things. Hypochondria is an illness where a person thinks they have every single illness they hear about.",

        "@dangergirl101 But if it weren't for the 6 hour tattoo they would have been eliminated just based off the black and grey tattoo.",
        "@dangergirl101 Yeah but she's got more critics. Like Matt seems more about tattooing and letting Katie be the villain.",
