        "two strangers\nwho were,\nit soon appeared,\nnot men at all,\nbut gods.",
        "Oh, to love what is lovely, and will not last!",
        "When this book ends\nI will pull it inside-out like a sock\nand throw it back in the library.",
        "moon snails, pale pink and barnacle scarred\u2014",
        "Whoever named the place learned the hard lesson,\nI'd guess, without much fanfare or delay.",
        "we keep ourselves alive,\nif we can, taking one after another\nthe necessary bodies of others, the many\ncrushed red flowers.",
        "and for every person\nthe body glowing inside the clothes\nlike a light.",
        "it needs the body's world,\ninstinct\nand imagination\nand the dark hug of time,",
        "and to do this\nI will go indoors to my desk --\nI will sit in my chair --\nI will look back\ninto the lost morning",
        "we are risen, tangled together, certain to fall\nback to the sea.",
        "while everywhere I look on the scratchy hillsides\nshadows seem to grow shoulders.",
        "but still they asked for nothing\nbut the difficult life\nwhich they had already.",
        "No doubt he thought of everything\nthat had happened in his difficult life.",
        "Every year\nthe lilies\nare so perfect",
        "I will look back\ninto the lost morning\nin which I am moving, now,\nlike a swimmer,",
        "I'd watch the face, how the mouth\nhas to work, and see any strain, any\nsign of what lifted the voice.",
        "and every pond,\nno matter what its\nname is, is\nnameless now.",
        "Then you begin, slowly, to read the whole story.",
        "We hope for magic; mystery endures.",
        "all day I think of her \u2014\nher white teeth,\nher wordlessness,\nher perfect love.",
        "All summations have a beginning, all effect has a\nstory, all kindness begins with the sown seed.",
        "Where, in what country, might I put down these thoughts,\nWho still am citizen of this fallen city?",
        "I think of this every morning\nas the east begins\nto tear off its many clouds\nof darkness,",
        "Every morning\nthe world\nis created.",
        "it is also this dazzling darkness\ncoming\ndown the mountain,\nbreathing and tasting;",
        "An echo,\ncontinuous from the title onward, hums\nbehind me.",
        "I wake earlier, now that the birds have come\nAnd sing in the unfailing trees.",
        "Because, properly\nattended to, delight, as well as havoc, is suggestion.",
        "whatever it was I said\nI would be doing\u2014",
        "to be more than pure light\nthat burns\nwhere no one is --",

        "I wake earlier, now that the birds have come\nAnd sing in the unfailing trees.",
        "And for all, I'd know more -- the earth\nbracing itself and soaring,",

        "A candleflame in Tibet leans when I move.",
        "we are risen, tangled together, certain to fall\nback to the sea.",
        "I thought the earth remembered me,\nshe took me back so tenderly,\narranging her dark skirts, her pockets\nfull of lichens and seeds.",
        "to love what is mortal;\nto hold it\nagainst your bones knowing\nyour own life depends on it;\nand, when the time comes to let it go,\nto let it go.",

        "Oh, to love what is lovely, and will not last!",
        "If I stopped and thought, maybe\nthe world\ncan\u2019t be saved,\nthe pain\nwas unbearable.",
        "and listen better to the wind\nor to the air being still.",
        "For myself, I find my wanting life\nImplores no novelty and no disguise of distance;",
        "You aren\u2019t much, I said\none day to my reflection\nin a green pond,\nand grinned.",
        "and I want\nto live my life all over again, to begin again,\nto be utterly\nwild.",
        "Thought buds toward radiance.",
        "Oh, to love what is lovely, and will not last!",
        "Today is a day like any other: twenty-four hours, a\nlittle sunshine, a little rain.",
        "One fall day I heard\nabove me, and above the sting of the wind, a sound\nI did not know, and my look shot upward;",
        "I'd watch the face, how the mouth\nhas to work, and see any strain, any\nsign of what lifted the voice.",
        "Here or nowhere I will make peace with the fact.",
        "If it is your nature\nto be happy\nyou will swim away along the soft trails\nfor hours, your imagination\nalighting everywhere.",
        "By now the hawk has flown five miles\nat least,\ndazzling whoever else has happened\nto look up.",
        "I think of the blueberry fields, the blackberry tangles,\nthe cranberry bogs.",
        "How long do they live, fluttering\nin and out of the shadows?",

        "whatever it was I said\nI would be doing\u2014",
        "And did you see it, finally, just under the clouds --",
        "All night\nin the brisk and shallow restlessness\nof early spring\nI think of her,",
        "It is dark in here, but the chapters open\ntheir beautiful spaces and give a rustling sound,",
        "like the rain pelting the trees, like a waterfall\nnifing down the black ledges?",
        "and after a while it rises and becomes a creature\nlike her, but much smaller.",
        "Slowly, beneath the branches,\nhe raised his head.\nHe looked into the faces of that frightened crowd.",
        "The first fish\nI ever caught\nwould not lie down\nquiet in the pail\nbut flailed and sucked\nat the burning\namazement of the air",
        "As for spiders, how the dew hangs in their webs\neven if they say nothing, or seem to say nothing.",
        "Surely\na beast might be clever, be lucky, move quietly\nthrough the woods for years, learning to stay away\nfrom roads and houses.",
        "edged\nwith pine boughs and wet boulders,\npawprints of bobcat and bear,",
        "The ants bore into the peony bud and there is a dark\npinprick well of sweetness.",
        "A candleflame in Tibet leans when I move.",
        "the air\nfinding every leaf and feather over\nforest and water",
        "On a cot by an open window\nI lie like land used up, while spring unfolds.",
        "until the white snow is written upon\nin large, exuberant letters,",
        "A perfect commotion of silk and linen as it leaned\ninto the bondage of its wings;",
        "Surely\na beast might be clever, be lucky, move quietly\nthrough the woods for years, learning to stay away\nfrom roads and houses.",
        "It offers me its busyness. It does not believe\nthat I do not want it.",
        "the hard knife-edged love\nfor the warm river of the I, beyond all else;",
        "The smell\nis lurid and flows out in the most\nunabashed way,",
        "when they rose\nout of their mortal bodies,\nlike a million particles of water\nfrom a fountain,",
        "attracting\ninto itself a continual spattering\nof protein.",
        "Oh, I could not have said it better\nmyself.",
        "as we glide\nOver the final jutting mountainside,\nAcross the suburbs tangled in their lights,",
        "a white cross Streaming across the sky, its feet\nlike black leaves, its wings like the stretching light of the river?",
        "and, being the color of snow, catching the sun\nso they were, in part at least, golden.",
        "all the dreams of my blood\nand all outrageous divisions of time\nseem ready to leave,\nto slide out of me.",
        "it was\na flock of snow geese, winging it\nfaster than the ones we usually see,",
        "No doubt he thought of everything\nthat had happened in his difficult life.",
        "and to do this\nI will go indoors to my desk --\nI will sit in my chair --\nI will look back\ninto the lost morning",
        "while everywhere I look on the scratchy hillsides\nshadows seem to grow shoulders.",
        "and the old couple,\nshaken with understanding,\nbowed down\u2014",
        "It doesn't have to be\nthe blue iris, it could be\nweeds in a vacant lot, or a few\nsmall stones;",
        "As for spiders, how the dew hangs in their webs\neven if they say nothing, or seem to say nothing.",
        "Under the orange\nsticks of the sun\nthe heaped\nashes of the night\nturn into leaves again\nand fasten themselves to the high branches --",
        "so it enters us --\nin the morning\nshines from brute comfort\nlike a stitch of lightning;",
        "Slowly, beneath the branches,\nhe raised his head.\nHe looked into the faces of that frightened crowd.",
        "while all around me the lilies\nare breaking open again\nfrom the black cave\nof the night.",
        "When anyone talked to me, whether\nblame or praise or just passing time,",
        "to love what is mortal;\nto hold it\nagainst your bones knowing\nyour own life depends on it;\nand, when the time comes to let it go,\nto let it go.",
        "Which is the only way to love, isn't it?\nThis isn't a playground, this is\nearth, our heaven, for a while.",
