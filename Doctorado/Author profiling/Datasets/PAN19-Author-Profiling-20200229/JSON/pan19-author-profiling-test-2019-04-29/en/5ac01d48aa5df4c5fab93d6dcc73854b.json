        "and down tumble\na few orange feathers into\nthe dark water.",
        "Okay, not one can write a symphony, or a dictionary,\nor even a letter to an old friend, full of remembrance\nand comfort.",
        "giving off the rich\nfragrance of cinnamon\nand fulfillment,",
        "I slept as never before, a stone on the river bed,\nnothing between me and the white fire of the stars\nbut my thoughts,",
        "In the season of snow,\nin the immeasurable cold,\nwe grow cruel but honest;",
        "Evenings out there on the plains\nwhen sunset donated farms\nthat yearned so far to the west that the world\ncentered there and bowed down.",

        "that it is more than the sum\nof each flawed blossom rising and fading.",
        "I don't even think\nof the eventual corruption of my body,\nbut of how quaint and humorous they are,\nlike a collection of doorknobs,\nhalf-moons,\nthen a yellow drizzle of flying saucers.",
        "At night, sometimes,\nthey slip between the pink lobes\nof the moccasin flowers and lie there until dawn,",

        "So now there are two. And they walk together\nlike a dream under the trees.",
        "and softly,\nlamp-eyed,\nbecomes the perfect, billowing instrument\nas it glides\nthrough the wind\nlike a knife.",
        "an invisible line\nupon which their iridescence caught fire\nas the sun caught them, sliding down.",
        "I go down to the edge of the sea.\nHow everything shines in the morning light!",
        "then they rose, tiny fireworks,\ninto the leaves\nand hovered;",
        "what a pearly rubble\nfrom which to choose a house\nlike a white flower\u2014\n\nand what a rebellion\nto leap into it\nand hold on,\nconnecting everything,",
        "Alone,\nin the crown of the tree,\nI went to China,\nI went to Prague;\nI died, and was born in the spring;\nI found you, and loved you, again.",

        "But what in this world\nis perfect?",
        "I slept as never before, a stone on the river bed,\nnothing between me and the white fire of the stars\nbut my thoughts,",
