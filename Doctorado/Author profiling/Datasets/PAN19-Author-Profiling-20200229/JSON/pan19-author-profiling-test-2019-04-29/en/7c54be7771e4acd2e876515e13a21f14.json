        "@logical4ever @iam_merricat @sk2011231 @sahluwal Yeah.  Absolutely. My only problem was the call to sack her.  Rather than the call to prosecute her.  And the attempt to pressurise her work to  act outside the law",
        "@iam_merricat @logical4ever @sk2011231 @sahluwal Where did i change my story.  At what point.  All i ever said was she should not be dismissed outside of being found guilty.  Not that she could not be placed on administrative leave",

        "@iam_merricat @logical4ever @sk2011231 @sahluwal No contradiction.  If you break the law.  You get prosecuted under the law.   But your employer should not be punishing outside of the law.  If your guilty.  Employer can step in before then they have no grounds",

        "@logical4ever @iam_merricat @sk2011231 @sahluwal Then she should be found guilty of a crime before she loses her job. If works sack people before someone found guilty just because of a social media storm.  Then your only a small step away for being sacked as enough conservatives take offence to your socialist leanings",
        "@iam_merricat @logical4ever @sk2011231 @sahluwal If a crime is committed  Prosecute. If no crime has been committed why should a work be allowed to sack you.   And if there is a gap in the legal system that should be filled. Not justice taken into our own hands.  That is lynch mob justice",
        "@iam_merricat @logical4ever @sk2011231 @sahluwal Work places should not and can not be trusted to be the arbitration of justice.  That's why we have a legal system",
        "@iam_merricat @logical4ever @sk2011231 @sahluwal No being racist is never right.  I just don't believe in mob justice or any work being allowed to interfere in people's personal life.  We go down that route. What's to stop my work saying i see your a member of the labour party were going to sack you",
        "@iam_merricat @logical4ever @sk2011231 @sahluwal If she is then totally.  But i dont believe in what is the modern lynch mob mentality. Your private life is not your work life.  Should a work be allowed to sack you if you vote against their wishes etc.",
