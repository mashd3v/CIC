        "@LHollettBazouzi @theoandtheb @jetm13 @mengival It also bemuses me that people keep saying \u201che didn\u2019t say this\u201d when the words tax cut quite literally came out of his mouth.",
        "@LHollettBazouzi @theoandtheb @jetm13 @mengival Everyone seems to have forgotten we\u2019re talking about people who should be in school, not working a minimum wage job to keep themselves off the streets. It\u2019s not about the employment; for this age group, it\u2019s about the underlying social causes that resulted in their homelessness.",
        "@Mellmouse1 @ForKevansSake @OttawaRic Okay folks. Let me break it down for you all. LGBT *youth* aren\u2019t homeless because they don\u2019t have good jobs; most aren\u2019t of the age where working to support yourself is the norm. They\u2019re homeless largely because their marginalization is a multiplying factor.",
        "@theoandtheb @raganwald @jetm13 @mengival You calling a tweet that is factually accurate a \"material falsehood\" is the most obnoxious thing I've seen on Twitter today. And that's saying something... because this is Twitter.",
        "@DeetoriaDee Indeed it did.",
        "@Mellmouse1 @ForKevansSake @OttawaRic You seem confused about what we're all on about.\n\nThe concern is that Doug is woefully unaware of the underlying social issues that result in a higher prevalence of homelessness among LGBTQ youth. Hypothetical tax cuts for hypothetical jobs isn't a serious plan to address those.",
        "@theoandtheb @jetm13 @mengival It's really not. Hypothetical jobs leading to hypothetical tax cuts for people who are often saddled with unsupportive families and serious mental health issues is errant nonsense that adds no additional value over and above a tax cut today.",

        "@theoandtheb @jetm13 @mengival Now I'm just confused. This is the sort of thing that would have been nice to hear *Ford* address in his answer. Not sure why you'd be expecting me to do that for him.",
        "@theoandtheb @jetm13 @mengival I understand that you think the rest of his response adds value. I don't believe it does, because it all comes down to this: you can't pay less tax on a job you don't have.",
        "@theoandtheb @jetm13 @mengival I mean, really. You keep making my point for me: that Ford's response was uninformed, light on policy, and doesn't detail *any* legitimate ideas on how to address the issue he was asked about.",
        "@theoandtheb @jetm13 @mengival Homeless people paying less tax on a job 80% of them don't have is - wait for it - not a homelessness prevention strategy for LGBTQ youth.\n\nThat is the point. The point was made (quite successfully, it seems). Genuinely sorry you don't like how it was made.",
        "@theoandtheb @jetm13 @mengival You still haven't been able to identify what, exactly, I've allegedly misrepresented. Is it the fact that he has no grasp on social policy? Can't be, since you've already conceded that's the case.",
        "@theoandtheb @jetm13 @mengival Re-contextualizing his dodgy grasp on social policy as... a dodgy grasp on social policy you've conceded is the case? https://t.co/ez2GbXl1dQ",
        "@theoandtheb @jetm13 @mengival Sorry, was there another context I was offering in my initial tweet beyond, he showed a lack of understanding of the issue at hand? Don't think so.",
        "@theoandtheb @jetm13 @mengival If your defence of Ford is, \"but wait, there's MORE dumb stuff he said that proves your point, but you didn't include,\" you need to work on your messaging.",
        "@theoandtheb @jetm13 @mengival And this is supposed to be a comprehensive response to a question about homelessness in the LGBTQ community? I mean, really.",
        "@theoandtheb @jetm13 @mengival It's clear that it isn't out of context. Wishing won't make it so. Let's explore:\n\nPoint: Ford's answer to a question about social policy was ill-informed, relied on hollow economic slogans.\n\nEvidence: Ford saying a hollow economic slogan.\n\nTL;DR, no grasp on social policy.",
        "@theoandtheb @michmenhennet @FuzzyWuzzyTO \"Much persuading\" lol",
        "@theoandtheb @jetm13 @mengival My characterization was literally what he said. Nothing about his response was any more substantive, and I don't think you can fairly say I was hesitant to share a clip that is *publicly* available &amp; I've linked to multiple people. But keep up the good work, #FordNation warrior.",
        "@theoandtheb @jetm13 @mengival Yeah... Owen, I think the fact that he gave the response he gave clearly illustrates that he doesn't understand the issue. That's probably why the tweet got 500 retweets.",
        "@theoandtheb @jetm13 @mengival Actually, it's pretty well exactly what I shared in my original tweet. The question was, what's your plan. The jist of the answer was improve the economy and lower taxes. Therefore, no plan and no knowledge. I think you'll find that's exactly what said.",
        "@theoandtheb @jetm13 @mengival If the question is, \"what are you going to do to address LGBTQ youth and seniors homelessness,\" a coherent, policy-oriented response cannot possibly include \"cut their taxes.\" Period.",
        "Yeah, except I think experts who study this issue extensively would remind you that isn't much of a homelessness prevention strategy. But if you want to go about your life thinking it's that simple, then by all means. https://t.co/4Fu0XWhRpn",
        "@theoandtheb @jetm13 @mengival I think the point is that he doesn't have a grasp on the intersectionality of the issue, didn't directly respond to the question, and thinks that tackling homelessness is as easy as empty sloganeering.",
        "@Mellmouse1 @OttawaRic 1. They probably wouldn't because it's not new; Ford is hopelessly light on policy details, particularly when it comes to social issues. That's been widely reported on.\n2. You can watch the video yourself, fake news warrior: https://t.co/7v2ql17tSu",

        "@theoandtheb @jetm13 @mengival Frankly, it's not an issue top of mind for most major dailies. The question was asked by a rep of a small publication at the end of a media availability in a non-GTHA market at a time when coverage is shifting to the last dash.",
        "@theoandtheb @jetm13 @mengival The fact that I'm a staffer doesn't make Doug Ford's grasp on social issues any less tenuous; it just means that I'm louder about it.",
        "@JMCassels Never heard that before. If that's the case, I apologize!",
        "@LeslieMaggie Couldn't agree more.",
        "@stefancaunter @DPHowat Actually, I suspect the reason his team has taken him from three events per day to one and is featuring Christine Elliott at all of them is because they know that if we make the election about Ford, he's likelier to lose. But just one kid's opinion.",
