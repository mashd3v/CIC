This thread is actually funny to me.  Your actual tweets are just deflection and innuendo.  Try not making things up and not speaking for me?  Now back to you \"Mr. Least Racist\".",
        "@MemphisBraves @tamisawyer @JHoustonHill Bruh, you are putting words in my mouth at this point.  I never said that at all.  I live and operate in a very diverse circle.  YOU said you are \"least racist\".  Explain to me how could it mean something that I \"wish\" when you do not know me and you said it by second tweet?",

        "@MemphisBraves @tamisawyer @JHoustonHill Ok.  I agree with you.  They will vote conservative.  However, more often than not, a lil' racism goes with that conservatism.  Ppl her age are the children of those who supported Jim Crow.  Old habits die hard.",
