        "You can\u2019t say the same for New York as a whole vs. PA as a whole. Or, for that matter, NY in 2016 as a whole vs. NY in 2015 as a whole. A lot of things happened between those years aside from the tipped min. wage hike.",
        "We find that full service restaurant workers did better in counties just over the NY side of the border than those just over the PA side of the border. The only real difference between them that year was the tipped min. wage hike in NY.",
        "Our design was to compare counties on either side of the NY-PA border. Why? Because those counties are pretty much the same on either side. Same demographics, share the same labor pool. If a recession or bad weather hit Cattaraugus NY, it probably hit McKean PA just as badly.",
        "You need to employ a research design that controls for all the other factors that may cause restaurant owners to hire or fire or open or close, and hone in on what we\u2019re really interested in, the min. wage hike.",
        "So that is why we pointed out that looking at statewide aggregate data alone, as Saltsman does, is not helpful."
