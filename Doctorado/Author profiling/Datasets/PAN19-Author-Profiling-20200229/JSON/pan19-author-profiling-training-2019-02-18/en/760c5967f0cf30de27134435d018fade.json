        "@MarkHanna123 Turnout this year was also highest it\u2019s been in 20 years. And McAuliffe had disadvantage because Dems\u2019 turnout deficit vs. Republicans in off year elections is greatest when their party is in the White House.",

        "Now it appears county politics are catching up with demographics. \"Demographics is destiny,\" as Clinton's people said, but it takes longer than they thought, and includes backlashes along the way.",
        "So strange as it seems to see a Trumpian board chair in a largely immigrant, minority white county, or a trans and a dem socialist house rep in a historically GOP county, neither are really implausible.",
        "PWC has grown faster than rest of state, become more diverse, and a majority-minority county faster than even famously blue NOVA inner suburbs. But as this happened, county politics took a hard turn right.",
        "As of 2016, PWC is 23% Hispanic and less than 50% non-Hispanic white. Compare to 2010, when PWC was 9% Hispanic and 69% non-Hispanic white. 1990, 4% Hispanic and 83% non-Hispanic white.",
        "It also famously passed an ordinance in 2007 aimed at unauthorized immigrants that predated AZ's SB 1070, deputizing police to check people's papers, making PWC one of the counties with the harshest immigration statues in US.",

        "Establishment types will say Gillespie should have run as a moderate. Trumpers e.g. Ingraham are already saying he wasn't a credible populist and should have gone harder on anti-immigration stuff.",
        "Lesson of race should simply be running a xenophobic campaign in an immigrant state like VA doesn't work. But results will validate both sides of the GOP division.",
        "So by borrowing Stewart's talking points on immigration, crime, and statues, VA race became a test case of whether establishment GOP candidates can win on a Trump platform.",
