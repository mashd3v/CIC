        "@rugbyPhilBB @simonrug @ImKateMc It's the way the constitution works. \n\nIf anything I think a public vote gives a lot more validity too it. It's a clear statement from the electorate.",
        "@simonrug @ImKateMc Who makes the rules though? I agree with you but how do you have a fair system.\n\nTinfoil hat on here, but you don't want to give the state too big a hand in controlling speech.",
        "@simonrug @ImKateMc It's gotten a lot of attention in NI as abortion is still banned there. If Yes passes, NI people could in theory access abortion in ROI.",
        "@simonrug @ImKateMc Fair enough. However either you scrap public funding of parties (no issue there) or you retain. Otherwise you're discriminating. Dangerous territory.",
