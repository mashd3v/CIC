        "To make the case, against all evidence, that MS-13 is the biggest national security threat since al Qaeda, the Trump admin recounts the most salacious details of individual murders, whose victims are, incidentally, the same communities which Trump is denying TPS and deporting.",
        "MS-13 is not nearly as well organized as Mexican cartels, doesn\u2019t make nearly as much money as the Russian mob, and lives hand to mouth primarily through extortion. Its members are mostly teenagers. It targets members of their own community, and especially fellow gang members.",
        "In the same period, there were at least 1,875 homicides as a result of mass shootings.",
        "In terms of violent criminal activity, their activities drive lurid headlines but not overall crime rates. According to one estimate, there were 207 homicides linked to MS-13 members since 2012. That is out of 76,472 homicides nationwide for that period, or 0.3%.",
        "It bears repeating: unlike in Central America, in the US, MS-13 is a relatively small player in the world of gangs &amp; organized crime. MS makes up less than 1% of all US gang members based on FBI estimates. It is smaller than the Crips, Bloods, Latin Kings, and Aryan Brotherhood.",
