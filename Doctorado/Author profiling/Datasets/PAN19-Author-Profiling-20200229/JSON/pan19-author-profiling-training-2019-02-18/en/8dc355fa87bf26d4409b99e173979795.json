        "RT @MOReganIT: Is it beyond the competence of this lightweight Government, and the cheerleaders of this daft new politics, to understand we\u2026",
        "Ensure that when receivers or lenders take possession of a buy-to-let property they are required to honour the obligations of the previous landlord, including part four rights. \n\nUrgently rollout a cost rental system for social and other forms of affordable rental accommodation.",
        "Amend the Residential Tenancies Act to extend the definition of \u2018landlord\u2019 to include both receivers and lenders in relation to repossession of a property.",
        "Review section 19(5) of the Residential Tenancies Acts relating to \u201csubstantial change in the nature of the accommodation\u201d to avoid the use of renovations as an avoidance measure.",
        "Introduce a defence for tenants against eviction on the grounds of hardship similar to the provision in German law. \nAmend the Residential Tenancies Acts to bring licensees, including students, under the remit of the RTB and the Residential Tenancies Act.",
        "Ensure that the Rent Pressure Zones are policed &amp; the legislation is enforced. Introduce a criminal offence of raising rent beyond the permitted level.\nThe introduction of a Deposit Protection Scheme, already legislated for, &amp; a legal definition of deposit to mean 1 month\u2019s rent.",
        "Introduce indefinite tenancies &amp; a restriction on the grounds that a landlord can use to evict tenants.  \nRoll out Rent Pressure Zones nationally &amp; beyond the 3 years envisaged by the current legislation. The current rent protections in Dublin &amp; Cork will come to an end in 2019.",
        "In the meantime there are some steps the government could take immediately to help lighten the burden on people. In the context of the upcoming Residential Tenancies Bill the government should :",
        "I call upon the government to begin this process by formally inviting the UN Special Rapporteur to Ireland to report upon the current crisis and issue recommendations on the implementation of a right to housing in Ireland.",
        "address discrimination, focus on the most vulnerable and marginalized groups and to ensure security of tenure to all.\n\nIt would mean that the government would be obliged, in its policies, spending priorities and laws, to take the side of people rather than capital.",
        "It would recognise that a secure place to live is about human dignity and that adequate housing is a human right. A right to housing would mean that the government would be obliged to enact measure are needed to seriously tackle homelessness, prohibit forced evictions,",
        "What it would do is put in place a minimum level of protection for everyone. A constitutionally mandated safety-net which the state would be required to provide. It would mean the government, in its actions, had to reasonably vindicate that right.",
        "There is no express unambiguous right to housing in Irish law. Housing rights, if they are protected at all, arise out of infringements of other constitutional rights. A right to housing in the constitution would not mean a free house for everyone who needs one.",
        "When Leilani Farha, the UN Special Rapporteur for Adequate Housing was in Dublin in June she reminded us that homelessness is a human rights violation and demands a human rights response.",
        "It has produced a situation where 10,000 of us are homeless, where child homelessness has increased by 35% in the past year and where a bank which is 75% controlled by the State can deliver thousands of us into the hands of vulture funds to improve its balance sheet.",
        "The financialization of housing - when housing is treated as a commodity rather than a right, &amp; an investment rather than a social good - has produced a situation where housing is disconnected from its primary function of providing a place for people to live in dignity &amp; security",
        "Access to adequate housing is a precondition for the enjoyment of other human and socio-economic rights, including the right to work, health, privacy and education.",
        "A home is the basis of our emotional, spiritual and family life. It is a place to retreat to and a sanctuary from the world. Everyone should have the right to live somewhere in security, peace and dignity.",
        "In February 2014 the Constitutional Convention recommended that a right to housing be included in the constitution. It\u2019s time to listen to that call and act on the recommendation, as a matter of urgency.",
        "We have seen that when we put our minds to it we can bring about changes that once seemed unimaginable. It\u2019s time to do that again.",
        "and I offer the occupiers my full support. \n\nTwice in the last few years we have witnessed Irish women and men updating the constitution to create a fairer and more equal Ireland.",
        "The policies of successive governments have abjectly failed. The house being occupied is owned by a landlord who recently evicted dozens of our neighbours in horrific circumstances. The occupation of these properties is an understandable reaction to the current crisis",
        "The occupation of vacant properties in the North Inner City demonstrates the need for a constitutional right to housing. \n\nThe peaceful occupation of vacant properties in the Summerhill is evidence, if any were needed, that public anger at the housing crisis is at boiling point.",
