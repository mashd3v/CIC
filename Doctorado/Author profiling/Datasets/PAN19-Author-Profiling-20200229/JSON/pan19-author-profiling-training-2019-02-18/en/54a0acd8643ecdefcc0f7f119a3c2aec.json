        "@gazzarinho1 @dannycummings67 @chris_sutton73 @Record_Sport Forrest off form. Tends to need a run of games to be up to it. Good option but we do need someone of Roberts quality coming in",
        "@mickmccorriston @chris_sutton73 @Record_Sport I'm pretty confident about it. More fit players back and Rosenberg are better away from home. I'll be a bag of nerves though!",
        "@gazzarinho1 @dannycummings67 @chris_sutton73 @Record_Sport Would say on the pitch we're abs fine. Just one bad game against a good team. Too much off field stuff but it's all fan and board driven",
        "@mickmccorriston @chris_sutton73 @Record_Sport That was the problem on Wednesday but Sinclair Hayes and Forrest could do that. A striker always best option but there are good alternatives",
        "@mickmccorriston @chris_sutton73 @Record_Sport On Wed it wasn't done properly. Rogic too immobile and too deep. Striker of course ideal but buying 2nd rate to plug a gap not the answer",
        "@mickmccorriston @chris_sutton73 @Record_Sport It's not a case of more strikers magically means more goals though. You can play with 3 mobile wingers and score a bundle if done properly",
        "@josephduffy81 @chris_sutton73 @Record_Sport Would such a player be good enough though? I can't think of anyone that ticks that box and would be good enough to perform when needed",
        "@josephduffy81 @chris_sutton73 @Record_Sport Exactly, that's why a top quality winger, Roberts or similar, is more important.  We lack depth there and can't keep 3 top strikers happy",
        "@fill_phteven @chris_sutton73 @Record_Sport Before the game I thought Rogic up top was a great call. Turned out not to be. We created more when Hayes came on but another winger needed",
        "@gazzarinho1 @chris_sutton73 @Record_Sport Very true. Off pitch issues and GB very divisive among fans right now",
        "@chris_sutton73 Rogic up top didn't work. Rodgers will learn frm that, that's what top managers do\nThe fickleness (If that's a word!) of some fans is unreal",
        "@chris_sutton73 @Record_Sport We had Forrest Sinclair and Roberts up top in that 5-0 win. No strikers but they constantly moved the defence around and swapped positions.",
        "@chris_sutton73 @Record_Sport We scored 5 at Tynecastle with no strikers. Lack of mobility the problem. Spend on a winger that can finish and stretch the defence more",
