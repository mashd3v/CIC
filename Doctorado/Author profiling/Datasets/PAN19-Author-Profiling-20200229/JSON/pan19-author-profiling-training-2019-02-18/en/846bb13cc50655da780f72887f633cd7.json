That leaves $200,000 for other rare accessories like high end watches and handmade shoes.",
        "@wxgeek @senatorshoshana It's not hard to spend $800,000 on clothes if someone wants expensive fabrics. A bespoke suit with high-twist (Super 180s and above) wool will be $10-20k from a high-end tailor. Vicu\u00f1a and other Veblen good fabrics can run as high as $50,000.",
        "@wxgeek @senatorshoshana Trump's tie length is awful and while he may intend a longer tie to cover his girth, it only draws attention by moving the eye lower on his body.
