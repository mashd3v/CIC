This file describes Cognitive Triad Dataset (CTD) to understand Beck's cognitive triad mechanism in an individual, which is crucial for early diagnosis and prognosis of depression. The CTD contains 5886 messages, including 4706 from the Tweeter, 600 from Time-to-Change blog, and 580 from Beyond Blue personal stories. Six well-trained annotators manually labeled the data. This data includes six classes: self-negative,  world-negative, future-negative, self-positive, world-positive, and future-positive. The CTD was evaluated on two subtasks: aspect detection and sentiment classification on given aspects. The dataset will assist in understanding Beck's Cognitive Triad Inventory (CTI) items in an individual's social media messages.
